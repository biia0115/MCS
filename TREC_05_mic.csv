CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT POLICIES A California firm's two workplace policies barring abusive and threatening language and restricting solicitation and distribution did not constitute unfair labor practices, the District of Columbia Circuit rules, overturning a National Labor Relations Board decision (""Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transp. N.A. Inc. v. NLRB, ""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1282, 6/26/01). The board held the workplace conduct policies of Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation N.A. Inc. interfered with employees' exercise of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act. The board ordered that a second election be held to determine whether Adtranz employees in Pittsburg, Calif., wanted to be represented by the Machinists Automotive Trade District Lodge 190 of Northern California. The appeals court finds it lacks jurisdiction to consider Adtranz's appeal of the order for a new election, because it is not a final order. The court rejects the board's view that the ban on abusive and threatening language was an unfair labor practice regardless of whether it actually chilled employees' exercise of their rights. Judge Sentelle finds the solicitation-distribution rule is legal because it ""only applies to conduct during working time and in the work place"" and ""applies across the board, so it cannot be said to discriminate against unionization efforts or other protected activity."" . . .

Northern States Power Co.,  ""7th Cir.,  No. 00-3746,  6/26/01). Loretta M. Emerson failed to show she was a ""qualified individual"" under the act, given that her anxiety attacks could interfere with her ability to answer customer phone calls about gas or electricity emergencies, Judge Bauer finds, affirming summary judgment to Northern States Power Co. Bauer also finds Emerson posed a direct threat to her employer, because her job ""required prompt, accurate handling of emergencies such as gas leaks and downed power lines that could pose significant danger to the public."" . . . Page A-8 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j5q2p6_ UAN DELEGATES VOTE UNANIMOUSLY TO AFFILIATE WITH AFL-CIO Delegates to the National Labor Assembly of the United American Nurses, the labor arm of the American Nurses Association, unanimously vote to affiliate with the AFL-CIO. If all goes as planned, the affiliation of the 100,000-member union will become effective July 1. However, it appears one more hurdle may need to be cleared before the affiliation, which has been in the works for more than a year, becomes a reality. The ANA House of Delegates is scheduled to vote June 30 on a bylaw change that would require any state nurses' association that engages in collective bargaining to be a member of UAN within four years. This was a condition of the AFL-CIO granting a charter. It is unclear whether the bylaw change will pass, and if it does not what happens to the affiliation agreement. . . .

New York City, ""S.D.N.Y., No. 95 Civ. 8283 (GEL), 6/19/01). Rejecting the defendants' other post-verdict motions, however, Judge Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York upholds the jury's award of $400,000 in compensatory damages. The court rejects the city's affirmative defense that plaintiff Alli Katt failed to take advantage of the New York Police Department's complaint process, finding that she was intimidated into not doing so because of explicit and implicit pressure. The court also rejects the city's late-raised challenge to the timeliness of the complaint. . . .

Hoffa and challenger Tom Leedham both are nominated for the union's top office.  Also nominated are current IBT Secretary-Treasurer Tom Keegel and Leedham running-mate Tom Gilmartin, the head of IBT Local 559 in Connecticut. Delegate voting will occur late June 28 to determine if the candidates received the requisite 5 percent support for their names to be placed on the ballot for the fall election among the union's 1.4 million members. That Hoffa will receive 5 percent of the delegates' votes is a foregone conclusion given his overwhelming support among the more than 1,700 delegates. Voice votes on various resolutions and constitutional amendments appear to show that Leedham has the support of only a few hundred delegates in his second challenge to Hoffa for the union presidency. However, Leedham and members of his campaign appear confident he will get the votes necessary to be placed on the ballot. Other members of Leedham's slate earlier received more votes than necessary to be placed on the ballot. . . . Page C-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j5g8z1_ OSHA READIES MANDATORY EMPLOYER SURVEY FOR DISTRIBUTION The week of July 2 will signal the launch of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's annual mandatory survey of more than 80,000 employers nationwide to gather injury and illness data to better target high-hazard employers. The agency, however, will not include construction employers in the upcoming survey. The 2001 survey program ""improves OSHA's ability to identify and target our  efforts on the more hazardous workplaces,"" acting OSHA Administrator R. Davis Layne says. The survey requests calendar year 2000 data. OSHA inspections based on the 2000 data will not be launched until January or February of 2002, the OSHA spokesman says. Employers will be asked to supply figures for average employment, hours worked, and a summary of the job-related injuries and illnesses that occurred at their work sites in 2000, the agency says.  The surveys must be returned even if a surveyed employer recorded no occupational injuries or illnesses for 2000, the agency says. . . .

GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region. 
""The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State,"" said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators. 
The lateral would begin at GTN south of Spokane and head west to the Mid-Columbia area in central Washington, across the Cascades to the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is served currently by only Northwest Pipeline. The ultimate route for the project has not been determined, and exact delivery points will be determined as the pipeline works out agreements with customers, the company said. ""I want you to know that Mount Rainier is in the middle of the route area we are looking at but we will not be going over Mount Rainier because it's a national park; there's no way we are going to do that,"" said a GTN spokeswoman. ""We're basically going to go from east to west over the mountains to I-5."" 
The pipeline companies in the Pacific Northwest have worked themselves into an expansion frenzy with two large mainline expansions and this new state-crossing lateral planned by GTN and four large laterals, including a new line to Vancouver Island, planned by Williams' Northwest Pipeline.  The power crisis has been the primary driver. Up until the last few decades, the region has relied on hydroelectricity and wood for its power generation, but now it is turning to natural gas.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

The doctor, after a lengthy examination, sighed and looked O'Malley in the eye and said, ""I've some bad news for you. You have cancer, and it can't be cured, you'd best put your affairs in order.""   O'Malley was shocked and saddened; but of solid character, he managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room. To his son who had been waiting, O'Malley said,  ""Well son. We Irish celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things don't go so well. In this case, things aren't so well.  I have cancer. Let's head for the pub and have a few pints.""   After 3 or 4 pints, the two were feeling a little less somber.  There were some laughs and more beers. They were eventually approached by some of O'Malley's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating.   O'Malley told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad.  He went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end.  He told his friends, ""I have been diagnosed with AIDS.""   The friends gave O'Malley their condolences, and they had a couple more beers. After his friends left, O'Malley's son whispered his confusion.   ""Dad, I thought you said that you were dying from cancer?  You just told your friends that you were dying from AIDS!""

No. 62, 6/28/01). On remand from the D.C. Circuit, the board decides 4-0 ""that when an employer has unlawfully refused to recognize or bargain with an incumbent union, a reasonable time for bargaining before the union's majority status can be challenged will be no less than six months, but no more than one year."" The board says the length of time that would be reasonable depends on an analysis of several factors--whether the parties are bargaining for an initial agreement, the complexity of the issues being negotiated and the parties' bargaining procedures, the amount of time spent bargaining and the number of bargaining sessions, the amount of progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are to agreement, and the presence or absence of a bargaining impasse. Applying these factors, the board decides Lee Lumber did not bargain for a reasonable time before withdrawing recognition from United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local 1027. . . .

Indiana Bell Tel. Co. Inc. d/b/a Ameritech Indiana,  ""7th Cir. (en banc), No. 99-1155, 6/27/01). Judge Easterbrook, in a portion of the ruling joined by four of the judges, rejects Ameritech Indiana's argument that the evidence is relevant to the issue of liability in sexual harassment cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and affirms $15,000 in compensatory damages to three female Ameritech workers. However on a second issue, Easterbrook, joined by a different line up of five judges, reverses a $635,000 award in punitive damages against Ameritech, finding that evidence regarding arbitration and the collective bargaining agreement was admissible as to the issue of punitive damages. Judge Flaum dissents in part, criticizing the majority's ""sweeping dictate"" that bargaining agreements are inadmissible in Title VII cases on the issue of liability. Judge Rovner dissents on the issue of punitive damages, arguing that the trial court's refusal to admit the evidence was harmless  error.  . . .

Moran, ""U.S., No. 00-1021, ""cert. granted"" 6/29/01). The high court will review whether Illinois' external review law is preempted by ERISA or whether it is ""saved"" from ERISA preemption because it regulates insurance, an area traditionally reserved for the states. The case arose after Eileen Moran tried to recover $94,841 in surgical costs she had paid after they were denied by Rush Prudential. In adding the dispute to its 2001-2002 docket, the Supreme Court opts to rule in a case the Justice Department, in an amicus brief, had urged the justices not to accept, on grounds that external review currently is being debated in Congress.  . . .

Among the 24 economists participating in the survey, all but one believe that growth will rebound by the end of the year to exceed the first quarter's anemic growth rate of 1.2 percent . Prior to the fourth quarter, however, three of those economists fully expect to see data showing that the country had slipped into a mild recession during the second and third quarters. . . . Page D-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j7j3a8_ NO NEW TALKS SCHEDULED IN IBEW DISPUTE WITH CHICAGO ELECTRIC UTILITY Two days into a strike by Local 15 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Chicago-based Midwest Generation Co. has ""no timetable"" for resuming negotiations over a new contract covering 1,150 of the electric utility's employees, a company spokesman says. The strike is ""not about money,"" he says, but rather language that the union was attempting to insert in the contract that would restrict the company's use of outside contractors for work beyond the scope of normal power plant operations. Maintaining that the company is misrepresenting its position in the dispute, Local 15 says no contract language has been proposed to impede or limit the use of outside contractors. Midwest Generation, it insists, is refusing to bargain in good faith. While, the company attributes the strike to a ""union failing to recognize that it no longer works in a utility environment, but in a competitive marketplace."" . . . Page A-2 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4j7b3m3_ SUPREME COURT LETS STAND NATIONWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY ENTERPRISES The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand a corporatewide remedial order imposed by the National Labor Relations Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises for its widespread pattern of unfair labor practices (""Beverly Cal. Corp. v. NLRB, ""U.S., No. 00-1563, ""cert. denied"" 6/29/01). The Supreme Court denies Beverly's request for review of a Seventh Circuit ruling substantially upholding the board decision. The board found the company committed more than 100 unfair labor practices involving 26 nursing homes nationwide. The board first issued a corporatewide cease-and-desist order against Beverly in 1993, but the Second Circuit overturned it, finding the evidence insufficient for such a broad remedy. However, the Seventh Circuit in 2000 found mounting evidence that Beverly ""continues to violate the law with regularity."" The board was ""entitled to conclude, especially after specific remedies in [the Second Circuit case] did not appear to stop the efforts from the company's central management to stop unions in any way possible, that the time was past for piecemeal relief,"" the Seventh Circuit said. . . .

***********************************************************************

FUNDAMENTALS AND REGULATIONS CHANGE WESTERN ENERGY OUTLOOKS

Western energy markets are heading into summer with shifts in the fundamental
and regulatory environment. New forces will reduce pressures on prices and
reliability as the power peak builds.

*  The June 19 FERC Order represents a strong dampener of power prices.

*  Energy demand is off considerably on a year-over-year basis.

*  Lower energy demand has contributed to an easing in natural gas prices in
California, but higher summer loads will likely bring higher gas prices.

Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know.  
Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe 
Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders. 
The cornerstone of ARC's approach is to build a consortium of political, producer, transportation and regional leaders; without aboriginal support, the plan would never succeed. However, Bob Murphy, point man for Houston-based ARC, said Friday that if all continues to go well, ""gas could be flowing by 2006."" 
Last week, aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project, including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project.  The Deh Cho, said Murphy, who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel, are now considering the proposal, and Murphy said he was optimistic. 
""Together, Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over 70% of the land in the Northwest Territories, through which a pipeline would travel,"" he said. Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower 48, he said. 
ARC's Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea, coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton. Following a ramp-up period, ARC estimates it would transport 4 Bcf/d through the high-pressure 1,200 mile, fully entrenched route. 
The pipeline would cost $4 billion, and financing and reserves would add another $1 billion to the cost, which would be 100% debt financed. The debt financing would lower the tariffs, making it attractive to shippers, promoters say. Murphy said he's hopeful that by the end of the year, ARC could begin its pre-application permitting process, but he added there was still much to be accomplished. 
""The ARC approach is all inclusive,"" Murphy told NGI. ""We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management. We believe our approach is far more than just a route. That's important to understand. Our approach offers the least expensive, the lowest tariff,"" he said. ""Politically, we have to take care of Canadian interests. We have to take care of the political issues in Canada, and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in. You have to do that to succeed."" 
ARC's proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the company's umbrella, Murphy said. The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline ""that will be required by the capital markets and industry."" 
What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum, executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp. (EMLC), one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline. The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities. The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp. also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum. 
EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the ""interests of Canada, the United States, industry, the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single, cost-effective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources."" 
What EMLC also likes, and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well, is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline --- an approach not used by other competing proposals. ""We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement, as proposed in the ARC approach, will improve the prospects for a safe, timely and economic project,"" said Tourangeau. 
ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund, who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp. in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost 30 years ago, said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders ""marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project."" He called the ""one pipeline approach with aboriginal support"" the ""fastest, lowest cost, best environmental and best political approach"" for the region. 
Now it's on to gaining more support, and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee, Murphy said. The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses. Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region, he said. 
Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline, as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington, DC. When asked how producer involvement was going, Murphy said the companies were ""doing the type of work anyone would need to do"" to study which option would be best for their companies. 
""At the same time, we're certainly hopeful that they're going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach,"" Murphy said. ""Of course, the economics of the project matter, but politics matter too. Pipelines have to work economically and not just at $9 gas. This is a long-term project, and we've put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it."" 
ARC's proposal is not the only one on the drawing board, but so far, none have gotten further than the proposal stage. No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals, which include two other major proposals: 
The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS): The ANGTS was approved in September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress. The proposal envisions a 5,000-mile joint U.S.-Canadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to 2.5 Bcf/d to the Lower 48. Portions of ANGTS already have been completed, with more than 2,600 miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States. The statutory framework between Canada and the United States also still exists. However, this project has languished and environmental reviews still have not been completed. Costs for the unbuilt segments range between $7-$11 billion. 
The Central Pipeline Route would follow the ANGTS to just below the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then travel southeast through the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge into the Northwest Territories and south into the Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta. This has languished mostly because of environmental protests of the route and less political support.

The Commission ordered Entergy to revise the credit provision in the agreements (and in Entergy's pro forma IA in its OATT) to provide for crediting of all network upgrades.  This is consistent with a May 2001 FERC order that required Consumers Energy to credit customers for all network upgrade costs, including those incurred to remedy short-circuit or stability related problems.

Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.  ""We received FERC approval within three weeks of filing - an unprecedented turnaround. This allowed us to expedite the construction process and bring additional supplies of natural gas to the California market,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. ""We anticipate most of the new natural gas will go directly to power generation facilities.""  The emergency expansion project added two new compressor stations in Utah and one in California, as well as upgraded compressor units at three existing compressor stations in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The installation of these facilities increased the transportation capacity on Kern River by approximately 19 percent. Williams completed the multimillion project more than three weeks ahead of schedule.  ""The extraordinary effort put forth by our contractors, employees and permitting agencies resulted in a successful completion of the project ahead of schedule,"" stated Micheal Dunn, manager of project management for Kern River.  With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. The gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. The expanded system has a design capacity of 835 million cubic feet per day.

Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near Palm Springs, Enron Wind Energy. It generates and sells power to utilities. The Enron subpoena asks for generation data. We will contact them Monday by phone. 	.EES has a small office in Long Beach. Amanda will talk to their employees Monday. 	. A Master Limited Partnership, EOTT Energy, also has an office in Long Beach. They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp. Please let us know if we should contact him. 	. Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality agreements with Enron's clients. Dave said the confidentiality of these documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron attorney in Portland -he suggested Karen Jones- to work on this issue with us. 	Document Retention: David said he is concerned that there is no clear corporate guideline for e-mail retention in his office. We should send him and the directors in that office (as well as all EES directors)  a clear directive as soon as possible. For the time being he is following oral instructions not to delete e-mail or other documents. Earlier, Amanda talked the EES IT manager, who said that it is not possible to automatically save e-mail from most EES personnel in California (those who are on the legacy e-mail system). Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the daily back-up tapes made  for the legacy system (just as we are doing for our Portland office). 	Telephone call with AG's office  regarding the EES subpoena: This afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel, a deputy AG who is temporarily in charge of the EES investigation. I told him we would produce some documents without waiving our objections, but needed to discuss any production with him beforehand. I repeated Bob's offer to meet next Friday. He said they would not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in writing we would produce documents. I told him we had no obligation to do that and wanted to meet with them first. He then said he would have his supervisor call me early next week. 	Directives to California officers: All the EES and Enron people we have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative. Given the time crunch, however, it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with the document review. The people to contact are Messrs. Reilly, Parquet;McDonald, Mara,Wright, van Ulden, and the head of the Enron Wind Energy Office. 	Review of EES documents at San Ramon: Amanda Smith spent the morning today there and gathered documents underlying the UC litigation. Lockyer knows this litigation and will probably use our positions in it to gauge our compliance with any production agreement. We will complete an assessment of these documents early next week.  We also found and took custody of the backup tape made in San Ramon May 25. Apparently no similar tape exists for Costa Mesa. We will identify and obtain earliest back-up tape that exists at that office. 	As we review documents for privilege we should know the identity of all Enron lawyers. Bob, could someone in your office act as a contact person to supply us with this and similar information? ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

I fixed the locking problem on the Build Route sheet.  Corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  This is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  

Corry,

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

As you know, the IRS plans to write the ""capacity"" of each syncoal plant into any private letters rulings it issues in the future.  Plant owners will be held to production at this level.         I spoke to Joe Makurath this morning about a rumor that he plans to hold one project that is seeking a ruling to a ""capacity"" of 198,000 tons a year.  Makurath is the IRS branch chief for section 29 rulings.  The ""rumor"" was actually a report by a tax lawyer for Detroit Edison that the IRS looked at actual output at his client's plant in 1998 and derived the ""capacity"" of the plant from this output.  The tax lawyer complained, but was told he could ""lump it.""         Makurath said the following:         1. He has made no final decision about how to determine capacity.         2. The IRS has issued only one ruling since the rulings window reopened in April.  That was a ruling to someone who already had a ruling, but who had merely changed the entity that owns the project.  The new ruling does not specify the capacity of the project.  That's because there was no change in process from when the earlier ruling was issued.  He regards a change in feedstock as a change in process.         3. The ""capacity"" will be the capacity of the facility when it went into service in June 1998.         4. He is still feeling his way on how to determine the capacity when the facility went into service.  Actual output is merely an ""interesting fact.""  Capacity is not the same thing as output.  Some people made representations about capacity at the time.  It would be ""strange"" if a facility that people thought was capable of producing ""100 units in June 1998 is now able to produce 1,000 units.""  That might call into question whether the facility was in service in June 1998 because it was just starting to ramp up.  (An old revenue ruling holds that a power plant was in service when it was producing at 17% of capacity and ramping up steadily from there.)         There was another rumor today that the IRS has backed off somewhat in the Detroit Edison case.  The taxpayer is hoping it can get a capacity of two times nameplate.  The coalition of syncoal owners is gearing back up to lobby Congress for help.

"""Hilgert, Chris"" <Chris.Hilgert@ENRON.com>",aredinger@mcdinvest.com,"Tue, 03 Jul 2001 11:40:16 -0500",Enron Compression Services Proposal,"Andy,

Per our recent discussions, you will find a proposal from Enron Compression Services to provide HP Services to KNG Energy to meet it growth expectations (either as is or through a new joint venture/ownership structure from the current bidding process).  We have made this proposal to conform with the expansion scenarios outlined in the offering memorandum and have provided flexibility for a 60%-90% load factor to be utilized for both stations.  We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you.  You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term.

We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets.  We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion.

I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily.  Once again, thank you for the opportunity and I will call you in the near future to discuss this proposal further.

Chris Hilgert
Director
Enron Compression Services

 
  

The parties hereto understand and agree that the PROPOSAL sets forth each party's preliminary understanding of the proposed transactions with KNG EnerGY and Enron compression services.  This PROPOSAL does not create and is not intended to create a binding and enforceable contract between the parties or a duty on the part of any party hereto to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract and may not be relied upon by either party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather this proposal evidences a non-binding expression of the understanding of each party to endeavor, without obligation, to negotiate the terms of a proposed transaction.

Attached is a memo discussing the law applicable to the Power Marketing Agreement.  

After discussing the matter with some attorneys around the office, the unanimous response is that North MS/Delta/Coahoma County is not going to be a favorable venue for any litigation involving Enron.  Juries all over Mississippi have recently become enamored with redistribution of wealth.  The demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the Clarksdale area suggest that a jury trial would not be a good experience for Enron.  

If you have any questions about the memo or other topics, please contact me.  Have a good 4th of July.

I am MISS FINA KATE a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney and Legal
Representative
to ""Mr. Larry Val"", a national of your country, who used to work with Shell
Oil Development Company in Nigeria.


On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and their three children
were involved in a car accident along Abuja Express Road. Unfortunately,
they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I have
made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client's extended
relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.


After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives
over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence,
I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money left behind by my client
in a Security Company here in Nigeria.
Particularly, the Security Company where the deceased deposited the two
trunk boxes containing $10 Million(TEN Million United States Dollars Only)
does
not know the content of the two trunk boxes deposited with them.


Consequently, the Security Company issued me a notice to provide the
Next-of-Kin
to claim the two trunk boxes in their custody within the next ten official
working days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased
to claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same country so that
the two trunk boxes can be delivered to you by the security company.


Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over to your country to
meet with you for the disbursment of the fund, and then you and me can share
the money.
60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can
back up any claim we may make with the Security Company.


All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal
through.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law.
Please reach me through my alternate e.mail address fina_kattie@jumpy.it.





Best regards,
Fina Kate.

handling private information. Under the bill, a person handling private data may
only use the data within the scope of the purpose disclosed to the individual
from whom the data was obtained. The bill also provides that the purpose must be

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

I noticed that Mexicana and ENA inadvertantly executed the  confirm that
referenced an ""Inside FERC"" Socal Border Index. I believe that  we had
revised the paperwork to reflect a ""Natural Gas Intelligence""  Socal
Border Price since that is the index used for fianancial settlement  in
the basis markets.  
The Inside FERC index is new (started  in March 2001) and reflects an
index of $4.76 for July whereas NGI  published $4.70. Should you elect to
hedge August, Sept and/or October, we  would need to amend the agreement
to reflect the NGI posting.
Here  are our options:
1. Substitue the first page of the confirm (I would  need to send it back
to you for initials) for July - Oct.
2. Leave the  Inside Ferc. reference for July and change Aug - Oct. to
enable future  hedging opportunities. We would need to create an
amendment for NGI if you  want to go this route.
Please call me to discuss at your earliest  convenience - I will be out
of the office this afternoon but back Monday  morning.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.   What worked: I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW. I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view) Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result. Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only. Things I did not expect that I liked: When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet. What does not appear to be working at this time: The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing. Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation. When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further. My conclusions: The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues. Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function. Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing. Thanks Cara 503/464-3814",0,0

Subject:	HR Organizational Changes


In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

�	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

�	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

�	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

�	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

�	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

�	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to ""talk to his boss"" because he ""didn't want to do anything wrong.""  

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,�.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um�..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back�.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back�.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or �.

ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)

Enron:  This is Ryan.

ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.

Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.

Subject: Tom McQuade's Deposition


Greg:

Tom McQuade's deposition was an adventure.  I spent all day Monday prepping
him and I could not get him to say a word.  When I asked him about the
issues re Massey, he said he remembers talking to Massey, but he didn't
discuss buying 3/4"" coal from Massey; McQuade said that his focus was on
selling the 3/4"" synfuel output and that Matt Arnold must have had the
discussions with Massey re buying 3/4"" coal.  Massey had an internal memo
saying that McQuade referenced a need for a 3/4"" top size because of
Sempra's PLR, but McQuade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about the
PLR, never discussed 3/4"" in the context of coal (as opposed to synfuel),
and said that Matt must have had those discussions.  In short, based on the
fact that McQuade wouldn't talk to me, I figured this depo would be a
breeze.

When we got to the depo, however, McQuade became ""Chatty Cathy.""  He had the
opportunity to take use one word answers, but he routinely felt a need to
expound.  For the most part, it didn't matter, because Jonathan Siegel was
taking the depo and was getting nowhere.  I kept reminding McQuade during
breaks to answer and shut up, and he kept acknowledging that that was what
he would do.  Once we resumed the depo, however, he kept falling back into
his habit of saying too much.  In the afternoon, I cut him off at points:
""You've answered that question.  Now wait for the next one.""

More importantly, McQuade's testimony regarding Massey began to sound
evasive to me.  He was looking back and forth at the internal Massey
correspondence as if a light had gone off in his head, but was still saying
that he didn't discuss purchasing coal.  The Massey stuff is not a big issue
in the case, and I started fearing that McQuade's testimony would make it
one -- e.g., they read in the Massey depo, read parts of McQuade and then
say that McQuade lied about it.  McQuade had one other big screw-up: after
testifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within 2x0
coal, McQuade said near the end of the day that he told someone in Enron in
November that 2x0 has 30-35% 2x3/4 coal.

During a break late in the afternoon, I asked McQuade what happened with the
Massey testimony.  He said that, after seeing again the internal Massey memo
(written by a guy McQuade knows and trusts) saying that McQuade referenced a
PLR and a 3/4"" top size, he began to believe that he MUST have said that to
the Massey guy.  I asked McQuade what he recalled about it.  He said that he
really didn't recall anything other than that he might have referenced size.
He still didn't think he referenced a PLR.  He then told me that the meeting
referenced in the memo was a dinner meeting, he'd had a few drinks, etc.  I
then asked McQuade about the size distribution testimony.  I suggested to
him that 30-35% might be the an outside limit of 2x3/4 coal in 2x0, and
McQuade agreed.

Based upon the foregoing, I asked McQuade just a handful of questions when
Siegel finished (it was 6:20; we started at 9:30).  I think it is the first
time I ever asked clean-up questions of my own witness, but I didn't want
this testimony to stand as it was, and I was sure that I would not want
McQuade at trial to clean it up then.  The size distribution testimony went
smoothly.  McQuade reiterated his testimony from earlier in the day re the
many factors that affect the size distribution within 2x0 and that, because
of those factors, there can be no standard distribution.  I then asked what
he meant when he gave the 30-35% testimony; he said that that was the upper
limit, and that it was by no means a standard.  Enough said on the issue, I
dropped it.

Re Massey, I directed McQuade's attention to the internal Massey memo and
asked whether it refreshed his recollection about discussing coal size with
Massey.  McQuade said that, because he knows the author of the memo, if the
author says McQuade referenced coal size, McQuade must have done so.
McQuade then said that he still doesn't recall any details whatsoever about
the discussion, having had drinks over dinner, etc.  He also testified that,
notwithstanding the reference to a PLR in the memo, he still didn't think he
referenced a PLR because McQuade doesn't think he even knew about a PLR.
McQuade surmised that the Massey guy might have just been assuming that a
PLR was involved.

Siegel then tried to question McQuade again about the Massey meeting, but he
did nothing but screw up the record.  McQuade, for example, testified for
the first time (Siegel hadn't asked before) that he'd actually had 2
meetings with Massey, the second one being with Matt Arnold and Kevin
McGowan.   While Siegel was questioning, I started packing up my things as a
reminder to Siegel that McQuade had a flight to catch.  Siegel ""took the
bait"" and, after muddying up the record some more, he decided to terminate
the deposition rather than keep McQuade there to learn about his new
recollection.  Siegel said he had no further questions and McQuade and I
were out of the building in seconds.

Bottom line: McQuade was a below average to bad witness, but he ultimately
didn't damage our record.   Because Mel will likely come back at Matt Arnold
about the Massey meetings in an effort to clean up what Siegel left so
muddy, we should be prepared for that.

      Notes:  Data for 1995 through 1999 are final.  All other
  data are preliminary unless otherwise noted.  Estimates for the
  most recent two months are derived from the Short-Term
  Integrated Forecasting System (STIFS). See Natural Gas Monthly,
  Appendix A Explanatory Note 7 for a discussion of revision
  policy.  Gas in storage at the end of a reporting period may
  not equal the quantity derived by adding or subtracting net
  injections or withdrawals during the period to the quantity of
  gas in storage at the beginning of the period.  Totals may not
  equal sum of components because of independent rounding. 
  Geographic coverage is the 50 States and the District of
  Columbia.

      Notes:  Data for 1995 through 1999 are final.  All other
  data are preliminary unless otherwise noted.  Estimates for the
  most recent two months are derived from the Short-Term
  Integrated Forecasting System (STIFS). See Natural Gas Monthly,
  Appendix A Explanatory Note 7 for a discussion of revision
  policy.  Gas in storage at the end of a reporting period may
  not equal the quantity derived by adding or subtracting net
  injections or withdrawals during the period to the quantity of
  gas in storage at the beginning of the period.  Totals may not
  equal sum of components because of independent rounding. 
  Geographic coverage is the 50 States and the District of
  Columbia.

i assume that Cindy Olsen has yet to get you an answer.  Enron may get a

Idris Rabiu <irabiu@walla.com>,,"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 10:03:49 +0200",For your notice.,"Greetings,My name is Idris Rabiu, of Auditing and Accounting Department of a prime bank in Africa. It is my humble desire to bring to your notice a transaction which I consider most strictly confidential, and I will like to let you know that I have made series of enquiry on this issue.To start with, may I solicit your trust, worthiness and confidence on this issue, for the nature of it and my position as an auditor in the bank, it is unlawful to expose any customer’s banking information to a third party, but for business sake, let it be a secret between both of us.I became the head of auditing and accounting in the year 1997. In that same year, I carried out a general auditing, then I discovered that there is an account opened in this bank in 1992. After going through some old files in the records, I went further to investigate this account, I realised that the owner of this account who is a foreigner, died in 1999, unknown to the relatives that such account is existing. My investigation revealed to me that no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it such that the account has no trace of other beneficiary.The management is ready to approve this payment to any legitimate foreigner who has correct information of this account. In this regard, I need your full co-operation to make this deal successful if you are capable and willing to handle the transaction for our mutual benefit. According to the law, at the expiration of five (5) years from the death of the owner, the money will revert to the ownership of the State if nobody applies to claim the fund. I want to quickly transfer this fund into a safe foreigner's account, but I do not know any foreigner, hence I am contacting you because as a foreigner you can assist us remit receive the fund. This is a lifetime opportunity I would not want to miss.I have to assure you that with my position in the bank I can transfer this money to any reliable foreign account, which you can provide with full assurance that this money will be safe and well guided. I will destroy all document of transaction in my office immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the Finance Ministries and Foreign Exchange Departments. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.I therefore request for your co-operation to quietly provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money. I place this faith in you believing you will be a most reliable and honest person to do business with. I would therefore need your word of honour to co-operate with me with utmost sincerity until the good objective of this business is realised. For your co-operation and assistance you will be rewarded adequately when you receive this money.Kindly treat as urgent and strictly confidential as I await your response at your earliest convenience.PLS.

Originally, on moving Azurix back into Enron CRM, it was decided to leave Azurix on a separate insurance program to retain flexibility for potential sale activity.  (We did combine them into the Enron Directors and Officers Liability program as Azurix could no longer carry their own coverage, following the ownership change.) We have not considered the options in the event of a sale, should Wessex and a select few assets not be included.  I understand that the current liability limit maintained by Azurix is $600,000,000.  The Enron limit is more than that.  As an Enron subsidiary, low liability limits are not acceptable and in those cases where ""separate"" programs are purchased,  the excess amount above the separate program is maintained here.

I am proposing to cost this on the basis of reverting back to a    standalone    insurance programme for Wessex as opposed to being part of the Azurix    Global    Insurance Programme.  The main reasons for this are:    Following the hefty premium rise in 2001 the global programme is now on    a    par with a standalone programme with regard premiums but more expensive    overall due to the much higher excess levels at Azurix.    Due to the above it could easily be argued that the global programme is    not    offering best value for Wessex acting as a standalone company which of    course it must do under its licence - this causes potential 'RAG 5'    problems    with the regulator.    The levels of coverage previously enjoyed by Wessex prior to the global    programme had been more than adequate for approximately 10 years.    If AZX assets are sold this year there may be no need for an Azurix    programme but to consider absorbing Wessex into any Enron programme will    probably only add to the problems above given that Wessex and Enron are    such    diverse entities in terms of size, activities, locations and therefore    insurable risk.    Please could you confirm what I am proposing is OK with Enron.    Regards.

Communications Workers of Am. Local 1100, ""2d Cir., No. 00-9182, 7/5/01). Vacating an arbitration decision in the union's favor, the appeals court affirms a federal district court decision that the agreement violates the Labor-Management Relations Act's prohibition on employer payments to unions. The appeals court decides the payments do not fit statutory exceptions for deducting dues from employees' wages or paying an arbitration award. . . . Page AA-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k2a9u4_ HOSPITAL MAY HAVE TITLE VII LIABILITY FOR PATIENT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT OF DOCTOR A Kansas psychologist who was sexually assaulted by a patient can sue her former employer, a Topeka mental health center, for violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by failing to take reasonable measures to protect her from a hostile environment created by sexually aggressive patients, the Tenth Circuit rules (""Turnbull v. Topeka State Hospital, ""10th Cir.,  No. 00-3086,  7/5/01). Reversing a trial court's judgment as a matter of law for the now-defunct Topeka State Hospital, Judge Seymour holds that a reasonable jury could find that Cynthia Turnbull presented enough evidence that the hospital knew or should have known that the patients were creating a sexually hostile environment but did not take appropriate remedial steps to address the dangers their behavior created. . . . Page A-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k2a6f3_ UNION MEMBERS AT DISNEY WORLD APPROVE THREE-YEAR CONTRACT Members of six union locals representing hourly employees at Walt Disney World Co. approve by nearly a 2-1 margin a new three-year contract covering some 25,000 workers at the Orlando, Fla., entertainment complex. The accord raises the new-hire rate by 35 cents to $6.70 per hour, enhances the pension benefit for long-term employees, limits the amount of health-care premium increases that can be passed on to employees, and commits Disney to remaining neutral in any union organizing among currently unrepresented part-time employees. The new agreement continues the two-tier wage structure first included in the contract during the last round of negotiations in 1998.  Employees on the first tier, hired before Dec. 12, 1998, who are at the top of the five-year wage scale, will receive a 2 percent increase retroactive to April 1, a $1,000 lump-sum cash payment in October, and lump sums of $1,500 in October 2002 and 2003. For second-tier employees hired after Dec. 12, 1998, the new contract upgrades the wage rates at the various steps of the progression, establishing a five-year top rate of $8.57 per hour as of July 2004. . . .

On the same day, a bankruptcy court judge sets a July 30 hearing to consider approval of the agreement. The tentative agreement would provide the company with millions in savings through restructuring work arrangements as well as restructuring health care to reduce costs. It also would eliminate significantly more steelworker jobs than the company originally had proposed, but would give union members 20 percent ownership, two seats on the board of directors, and profit sharing, once LTV returns to profitability. . . .

The memorandum of understanding lists 10 principles aimed at improving the process under which the agencies are to notify each other of chemical explosions at chemical plants. Although it has no enforcement authority, the Chemical Safety Board offers recommendations for rulemakings to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other state and federal agencies.  ATF, a division of the Treasury Department, enforces criminal law related to arson and explosives. Under the agreement, both the chemical board and ATF will rely on sources such as the National Response Center, a federal operation open 24 hours a day, for initial notification of chemical releases. The board also will notify the ATF Enforcement Operation Center, based in Washington, D.C., when it begins an investigation of a chemical accident. The agreement is designed to prevent duplicative investigations and minimize disputes over jurisdiction in investigations. . . .

I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the Beach Bowl 2001 for ALS.  My grandmother passed away from this debilitating disease in 1986 and since then there has been only one small breakthrough in the treatment.  Hopefully with your donations and those of others we can make a difference for those suffering from ALS. It means a great deal to me that you were able to help out even though the event was so far away from Portland. Thank you again for your support and I miss everyone.

After reviewing the password applications available on the Clickpaper and EnronOnline websites it appears that several countries have access to EOL but not to Clickpaper (please see attached).    Since due dilligence has already been completed for the EOL countries and soon Clickpaper will migrate to the EnronOnline trading platform, it seems it might not be too difficult to add mirroring Clickpaper password applications.

We do not always gain by changing. . A bad penny always comes back. . A good thing is all the sweeter when won with pain. . All the day you'll have good luck..  
Clothes make the man.   
  
When a fox hears a rabbit screaming it comes running, but not to help.   

Never put off 'til tomorrow what you can do today. . Deeds are fruits, words are but leaves. . Like a fish out of water. . Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. .  
The wise man is deceived once but the fool twice.

CIRCUIT In two decisions involving AlliedSignal's acquisition of operations at an Army engine plant in Stratford, Conn., a federal appeals court upholds a National Labor Relations Board ruling that the company illegally terminated collectively bargained severance benefits, but overturns a separate board ruling that the company improperly ended a side agreement. The District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the board that AlliedSignal, which has since been acquired by Honeywell International Inc., committed an unfair labor practice by unilaterally terminating severance benefits when an agreement expired with the United Auto Workers regarding the effects of AlliedSignal's acquisition (""Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. NLRB, ""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1171, 6/29/01). Finding no bargaining impasse or union waiver, the appeals court decides AlliedSignal was barred from making unilateral changes regarding severance benefits, a mandatory subject of bargaining. The second ruling involves AlliedSignal's termination of a competitiveness agreement containing job protections. The appeals court decides the issue only involves contract interpretation, which is for arbitrators and the courts to decide (""Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. NLRB, ""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1170, 6/29/01). . . . Page AA-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k3f4e7_ NURSING HOME WORKER WINS FMLA CLAIM, MAY PROCEED WITH ADA SUIT A Pittsburgh nursing home violated the Family and Medical Leave Act when it fired a former assistant nursing director who took medical leave after being diagnosed with clinical depression, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania holds (""Wilson v. Lemington Home for the Aged, ""W.D. Pa., No. 99-1893,  6/25/01). Marva J. Wilson gave the Lemington Home for the Aged adequate notice that she needed to take the leave, but the employer failed to provide her with a written notice of her legal obligations, the company's expectations of her under its FMLA policy, and any consequence she might face for failing to meet these expectations, Judge Ambrose rules, granting Wilson summary judgment on her FMLA claims. Ambrose also denies the employer's bid for summary judgment on Wilson's claim that she was discriminated against in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k3d7p0_ http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k3b7e4_ OSHA PLANNING TO EXPAND INJURY SURVEY TO CONSTRUCTION IN 2002 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to expand its mandatory injury survey in 2002 to target between 15,000 and 20,000 construction companies, OSHA officials tell BNA. The expansion would represent the first look at an industry that so far has eluded a data-gathering effort, begun by the Clinton administration nearly five years ago. The plan, which one OSHA source says will be outlined in a ""Federal Register"" notice slated for publication in late July, is scaled back from a proposal unveiled a year ago to survey about 56,000 construction companies in 2001. The ""Federal Register"" notice is expected to seek comments on the proposal as the first formal step toward implementing the construction survey. . . . Page A-3 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k2x3e1_ NO ERISA BAR TO PHARMACIST'S STATE CLAIMS OVER CVS'S HIRING DATE Reversing a lower court,  the North Carolina Court of Appeals finds no preemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act on a pharmacist's state law action alleging retail drug chain CVS breached a contract and engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices by selecting an improper hire date for calculating his pension benefits (""Vaughn v. CVS Revco D.S. Inc., ""N.C. Ct. App., No. COA00-159, 7/3/01). Pharmacist William Edward Vaughn's state law claims do not attempt to require an employee benefit plan to provide particular terms or to regulate the types of benefits the plan must provide, the appeals court says.  Rather, Vaughn's ""claims simply seek to enforce, or secure compensation for the breach of an alleged agreement as to the date of hire for purposes of determining plaintiff's pension benefits,"" the court says.  Vaughn was hired by Revco drug stores on Feb. 15, 1972; in August 1995 CVS acquired Revco.  Vaughn alleged that CVS in hiring him confirmed by letter that he would ""retain [his] tenure showing a date of hire of February 15, 1972,"" and ""[a]ll benefits will be applicable per [his] tenure."" Vaughn brought suit in a North Carolina state court, however, after CVS agents later told him his pension benefits would be calculated as of the date he was hired by CVS in 1995. . . .

The Carpenters and Joiners District Council of New York and Vicinity negotiated separate agreements with the Building Contractors Association of New York and the Association of Wall-Ceiling and Carpenters Contractors of Long Island and New York City. Both agreements provide wage and fringe benefit increases of $14.52 per hour over the contract term. The agreements cover at least 9,000 workers. BCA also concludes a separate five-year agreement with the Mason Tenders District Council of the Laborers International Union that provides wage and benefit increases totaling $7.50 per hour over term for approximately 10,000 workers in the five boroughs of New York City. . . .

Dear Sir,
My name is Fred. I a Nigerian Businessman. Am into oil exploration.

I have a business to discuss regarding payment for an oil shipment which
I need to claim. I shipped the oil to India, but I am presently under house
arrest because I was involved in a problem with government. Let me explain.
Well, 6months ago I was arrested for involvment in oil bunkering(smuggling)But
I was released and placed under house arrest because the government did
not find any proof to convict me.Pls donnot be afraid to work with me because
Oil bunkering is not such a bad business and I am not a bad person.

You see, I am unable to travel to India to collect the payment for the oil
which I shipped there because of the house arrest.
What I need from you, is for you to go to India, and sign and claim this
funds from India.
I am being tried in Court. So untill I am pronounced innocent I cannot leave
the country. And I need that money so that my business and family does not
lack.
I need a foreign party to help me with the claim because it will be risky
to use any of my former partners ...I hope you understand my predicament.

All I need from you is to travel to India to sign and claim the payment
on my behalf,(in your name). 
OR 
We can arrange for an online banking transaction....please choose which
procedure will be better for you.

The amount in question is US$30.2m And I offer you 20% of it for your help.
If U are willing and able to work with me, I will send you more details,
and tell you how we can work in partnership. You see, Nigeria is the biggest
Producer of Oil in Africa and I am well connected and able to export more
shipments of Oil.
If you can be my partner you will help me to claim oversees payments.When
I ship the Oil.
I hope u understand and I hope to hear from you.

I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

I do not think that John's intent by speculating the Nymex was to detract from building the Wellhead business. I apologize for not knowing of the intraday speculative positions.  I receive his P&L daily and on average, his position is flat.

I have asked him to break out the subset of new producer counterparties that the Wellhead desk has brought to ENA.  Please find John the three seats near the East desk or the Weather group on 32.

I will focus all my efforts on building a wellhead business consistent with the expectations outlined in the meeting this morning.  I would like to have some additional feedback on the new entity ENA Upstream Company, LLC and third party transactions to mitigate risk.  

I will continue to assist the origination function to build producer volumes and improving the flow of physical information to the Trading Desks (Financial, East, Central, Texas and West). The Wellhead Desk will only use financial tools to hedge physical transactions. 

I will work with Jeff Story to improve the accuracy and flexibility of our systems in the areas of pricing, transportation, and forward curves associated with wellhead volumes. 
I look forward to providing you with the answers to the issues when you return from your vacation.

Dear Friend,

First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to communicate a
business proposal of this magnitude , this is solely because of the
confidentiality nature repose on the net; before I go on further, I must be
grateful to introduce myself. My name is Mr. Paul Wayne a Liberian. I was
formerly the chief campaign manager to Mr. Charles Taylor the president of
Liberia and I was also a personal aid to the Minister of trade in the depose
administration of Mr. Charles Taylor.Due to my position and closeness with
the President, I absconded with Thirty.Five Million United States Dollars
(US$30.5M) which was part of the money that was initially meant for
campaigning for President Charles Taylor re-election into office before the
recent crisis that led to his depose from office. Presently I have been able
to move the funds diplomatically to a reputable Finance Company in the
Netherlands where I now reside as refugee; and I do not have the intention
of returning home for fear of being assassinated by members of the
opposition party to Mr. Charles Taylor under whose administration I
served.MY REQUEST As a result of my present situation as a refugee who
cannot have access to own an account or accounts, I am therefore faced with
the dilemma of seeking for a trustworthy individual/firm that can advice me
in making the rightful investment as well as to provide account(s) where the
funds will be lodge into. More also, we are at the interim interested in
buying properties for residence as my family and I will be residing there in
the near future. Please be aware that my family are also in a safe location
and I am in contact with them.
 COMMISSION/REMUNERATION As regards your commission/remuneration, I and my
immediate family have decided to offer you 20% of the total sum and also set
aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e telephone bills, traveling expenses,
hotel bills and other miscellaneous expenses). NOTE: I shall commit half of
my own share of the total sum into a joint venture project preferably in the
purchase of Real Estate or other profitable business venture within your
knowledge existing in your area. Be assured that you stand no risk of any
kind as the funds in question belong to me alone. As soon as I get your
consent, I will furnish you with the details and contact of the Security
Company and after a few more details have being communicated, we shall then
proceed to arrange for a face to face meeting in order to know each other
better and also discuss the terms  and conditions of the partnership
extensively.I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this
and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter and it will
be a long lasting business association. If you have any question, do not
fail to contact me with my e-mail address (paulwayne@mmail.com) I await your
anticipated co-operation. 

Yours truly, 
Mr. PAUL WAYNE.

Beautiful.  

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating prejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's prejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs.  

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of performance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never ""accepted"" the meters.  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It was my great pleasure to have partnered with you on this.

Britt

Subject:	RE: Northern v. ONEOK

Britt,

We have done a thorough analysis of ONEOK's calculation of pre-judgment interest and are in agreement with their amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).  

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to Northern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars for the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calculation of the accumulated interest.  Since this is a dollar-valued OBA, each month's imbalance was valued at the appropriate monthly index price and a 6% simple interest calculation was applied from that month until the current period.  We had a significant amount of monthly imbalances due Northern early in the review period that carried forward very large credit interest balances due us.  For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG valued at ($753,541.27).  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 997 days (September 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amount due NNG of ($123,498.19).  For comparison purposes, contrasting with this month is a large debit imbalance due ONEOK of $769,407.44 for the month of December 2000.  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 113 days (February 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amount due ONEOK of $14,292.01.  By summarizing these two months, we have an imbalance value that is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net interest valuation due Northern of ($109,206.18).  This scenario plays out for the entire review period netting to a cumulative credit amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).

If you would like to review the calculations in detail, please let me know and I will forward the spreadsheet to you.

Rick, Harry & Tangie

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK
Importance:	High


	Harry,

	We need your help yet one more time.  Tomorrow morning I will have hand-delivered to you a letter from Ben Singletary, ONEOK's attorney, stating that they calculate pre-judgment interest (using Northern's methodology, which the arbitrators specifically approved--thanks again to you, Tangi and Rick!) such that ONEOK actually owes Northern about $50,000.  We certainly don't mind them owing us $50,000; however, we want to see if ONEOK owes us even more than that.  

	If you need additional information (such as the actual panel award), please call Becky Zikes and she will make sure a copy gets to you.  I will be out from about 9:30 to 3:00 tomorrow, but will be in later in the day.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

The ALJ also recommends that Avondale, which is now owned by Northrup Grumman, be required to reinstate 22 employees who were illegally terminated for their union activities (""Avondale Industries Inc. and New Orleans Metal Trade Council, ""N.L.R.B. ALJ, No. 15-CA-12639,7/6/01 [released 7/11/01]) In a 275-page decision, ALJ Philip P. McLeod further recommends that the company be required to reimburse both NLRB and the New Orleans Metal Trade Council for their litigation fees, as well as the NLRB general counsel's expenses in investigating the ULP cases. . . .

Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protections, asks sponsors of the legislation--Reps. Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Morella (R-Md.)--whether a new law is necessary.  He cites the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which prohibits private group health insurers from setting rates or refusing coverage to individuals based on their genetic makeup.  Saying only people who are currently insured are covered by HIPAA, Slaughter maintains that any congressional effort to ban genetic discrimination should encompass both employment and health insurance and should contain ""meaningful enforcement and remedies."" . . . Page A-8 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k4g1y2_ FORD ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN ANNUAL EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR MANAGERS Ford Motor Co. announces it is changing a controversial annual evaluation system for its approximately 18,000 managers and supervisors that has triggered a spate of age discrimination suits. In a memorandum explaining the change to employees, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jacques Nasser acknowledges that the original program had not been entirely well received, saying the negative feedback ""has centered around what was viewed as an inflexible system by some, and as discriminatory by a few others."" But he insists the evaluation program ""has ""nothing"" to do with age or diversity. It has ""everything"" to do with inspiring the best performance of ""everyone"" on the management team."" A class action lawsuit against Ford for age discrimination brought by about 60 managers ""is proceeding full steam ahead"" despite the company's announcement that it is changing the evaluation system at issue, class attorney Michael Pitt says. ""There are substantial economic and noneconomic injuries to these people, ranging from $20,000 to $50,000 each, and Ford has given no indication that it will correct these injuries,"" the attorney says. . . .

Simmons,  ""10th Cir.,  No. 00-3131,  7/3/01). A state's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suits in federal court that seek money damages for ADA violations does not apply where a plaintiff seeks prospective equitable relief from a particular state official, Judge Brorby holds, finding that Steve E. Frazier properly alleged a claim for injunctive relief against the secretary of the Department of Corrections. However, Frazier failed to establish that he was qualified for his job--a crime scene investigator--at the time he was terminated because he could not perform certain essential functions, the court says, affirming summary judgment for Simmons.  . . .

Immigration and Naturalization Service,""Fed. Cir., No. 00-1134, 7/2/01). Richlin Security Service Co. is not liable for the back wages owed to its security guards for services provided under contracts with the Immigration and Naturalization Service until it receives reimbursement from the agency, according to the court.  Overturning a decision by the Department of Transportation Board of Contract Appeals, the court upholds an agreement between the company and the Labor Department stipulating that the employees would be paid the back wages owed following reimbursement by the INS. ""In view of the DOL-Richlin agreement which assures Richlin will receive no benefit from these payments, it was unnecessary to require Richlin to pay the employees before INS supplied the funds to which it was obligated,"" the court holds. . . . Page A-2 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k3w7w0_ ELEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES ADEA PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT PLEAD DISPARATE IMPACT In a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit rules that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""Adams v. Florida Power Corp., "" 11th Cir.,  No. 99-15306,  7/5/01). ""The text of the ADEA is sufficiently different from Title VII [of the 1964 Civil Rights Act] to raise doubts about extending the disparate impact theory of liability to ADEA cases,"" Judge Birch writes. In addition, ""the history of the ADEA differs from the legislative history of Title VII."" The Second, Eighth, and Ninth circuits allow disparate impact claims under the ADEA, while the First, Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth do not, the court says. Finding the reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits persuasive, the Eleventh Circuit affirms a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida decertifying a class of former Florida Power Corp. employees who alleged they were discharged in violation of the ADEA. . . .

It is a suggested revision to the NERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are: *	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The table provides rules for the e-tag software to automatically set the flag. *	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e., tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval entities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags, etc.).  But, a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome review/approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced world of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the suggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer the submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we considered three parameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and the default composite status.   	*	The assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag. Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the final composite status. 	*	Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite status does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end of the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if appropriate. 	*	The default composite status is a final stated reached at the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to actively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status default to Denied. 	For real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where Purchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.   	*	Tags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred to 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to deferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional. 	*	Tags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called instant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional. 	*	Tags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called instant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite status of Late). *	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard.  The team was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the table be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to include in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times on the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros and cons of each suggestion. *	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag agent's time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service. *	Here's a big one - because the timing table allows for later submittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of the WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the hour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour (i.e., starts at 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would align the WSCC with the Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag submittals. *	There was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice for the tariff deadline for schedule changes (most are set to 20 before the start).  It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner. *	The team did not want to address at this time issues concerning multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy 3 or the E-Tag specifications. *	Finally, the team can not stress enough that a composite status of Late should not and does not mean automatic denial.  The Late designation simple indicates that the default composite status is Denied.  Approval entities should make every effort to assess all tags, Late or not. Hurray for the team members, many, many thanks.  <>  Robert Harshbarger Puget Sound Energy OASIS Trading Manager 425.882.4643 (desk) 206.604.3251 (cell)",0,0

I had created an alias in the Table edit, but listed 2 aliases, comma delimited.  Is it possible that each separate alias is going to have to have a separate entry?

Robert Johnston 713.853.9934


Here's what we know:

INSIDE ARGENTINA
Cavallo is at the edge, very reliably reportedly asking for more power from De La Rua or else.  Markets are already rife with resignation rumors
Domestic political opposition to deficit cut plan is general in Argentina - both in coalition and among opposition, particularly federal v. provincial leaders.  Implementing past cuts still incomplete and willingness to take further local, domestic pain for international markets is very weak.
Efforts afoot to try and swap out of short-term Letes (91-day) debt into 1 year, but current conditions (200%+ overnight rates) make it all but impossible

USTreasury, IMF
There is no sign of any willingness, either at the IMF or Treasury, to do anything for Argentina.  Recent events have only confirmed O'Neill's bias against bail-out - he believes it will only be a temporary save and that current problems will be constantly revisited going forward
USTreasury briefed Fed yesterday on strategy and the bottom line is that Brazil is seen as the best place to make a stand.  There are three arguments behind this: 
	- First, there is nothing that can reliably save Argy at this point and it is better to husband resources and credibility for use elsewhere if Argy blows-up; 
	- Second, there are reasons to support Brazil, both for itself and for international contagion concerns: defending Brazil is the best way to quarantine 	  Argy effects; Brazil has problems internally, but they are seen a more likely to be solved than in Argy aid that they have been exacerbated by Argy;  
	- Third, defending Brazil is seen as first line defense of Mexico, which is seen as necessary to defend for domestic US political and economic reasons, apart 	  from the additional international concerns.

Subject:	New Iowa Pipeline

Here is some additional information that we picked up regarding the pipeline right-of-way acquisition or discussion activities said to be going on in Iowa and it seems to fit the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group project.   This is prompting some talk by legislators to try again in the next session of the Iowa Legislature to toughen up Iowa's condemnation laws.   Should this in anyway influence what we contemplating in regard to the Iowa land restoration rules?

--It would not be an oil line
--Prudhoe Bay would be the source of supply
--It could involve a partnership of BP, Phillips and Exxon
--Its route would be to the northeast of Alliance pipeline
--It could be as large as a 50"" line
--Its could be about a $10B project

This seems to fit this project:

AlasCan Group Wins Conceptual
Engineering Work for Alaska Pipeline

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2001--The North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group (NANGPG), a consortium of ExxonMobil, BP and Phillips, has awarded a conceptual engineering contract for a multi-billion dollar pipeline that will stretch from Alberta to Chicago, Illinois, to a five-company joint venture called The AlasCan Group.

Currently, 18.2 million Americans have diabetes. However, a study released earlier this year by the CDC estimates that, if current trends continue, the United States may see as many as 30 million with diabetes by as early as 2030 More...Patented Technology, Focused Growth, Growing Demand -- Arden Oliphant, CEO of Diabetic Treatment Centers of America Inc.,  interviewed on Trad!  ersNation. Audio  The United States will spend approximately $130 billion this year on diabetic health care, the same amount it is spending in Iraq in �04.One American in three born after 2001 will develop diabetes during his or her lifetime.A 10-year study by the National Institute of Health reports that at least 37% of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics will need PIT therapy within 10 years of the disease�s progression.DBTC's patented treat!  ment is FDA-certified and Fully Approved for Medicare and Insurance Re imbursement.With a market of 2 � 3 million people in the U.S., and many millions of other severe diabetics world-wide, the need is desperate and HUGE.PIT is the first effective treatment that actually stops and even reverses the terrible complications, returning a diabetic to a more normal life. A diabetic visits a clinic for three one-hour treatments over a six hour period, sits in a chair attached to an IV, along with the Bionica pump and a RQ apparatus. The Bionica pump mimics that particular patient�s liver needs, to reestablish the ability to metabolize carbohydrates. Meanwhile the RQ equipment measures the precise carbohydrate and lipid metabolic levels. This monitors!   how well the body is regaining normality. The patient returns once a week. Within a few weeks, the patient should start noticing a difference. Within a few months his metabolism should be restored to near normal, and the diabetic deterioration will slow, stop and even reverse itself.Now diabetics can lead normal lives with the greatest FDA-approved breakthrough in over 80 years! Complications from this terrible disease can now be stopped � even reversed!Diabetes is the world�s fastest-growing disease. The No. 5 killer is responsible for a QUARTER of all deaths in many parts of the world. (Many more people die from diabetes than AIDS.)But every so often, something wonderful comes along that changes the lives of millions of people. It�s happenin!  g again with Pulse Insulin Therapy, and hundreds of thousands of peopl e will be given new lives. Never before has a single small public company played so dominant a role in the birth of such a large �industry.� For Diabetic Treatment Centers of America the potential is truly staggering. PIT treatment will permit hundreds of thousands of patients to live again. As only diabetics can truly know what that means.

IMPORTANT NOTICE - Modification to ISO Billing Procedure 

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable;


	The current process for issuing the FERC Fee invoices has changed.
There may be additional changes in the future which would require tariff
revisions.  

	For now, the process changes are as follows:

*	Instead of sending one preliminary invoice per month for FERC Fees,
ISO will issue one preliminary and one final invoice for every trade month.
*	The monthly FERC Fee invoices will be issued one business day after
the Market and GMC invoices are generated.
*	FERC Fee invoices will be somewhat similar to the GMC invoice and
they will be EDI'd (instead of being faxed) to the Market Participants.
*	A charge type has been created for the FERC fee (CT 550).  The
settlement statements for the last trade day of the month will include the
FERC Fee charges as manual line item entries.  

	If you have any questions about FERC Fees, please contact Mike
McGuffin, 916-608-5753 or Masoud Shafa, 916-351-2216, of ISO Settlements.  

	Thank you.


	FERC Fee - Market Notice

	Introduction

	FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from
the Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

	In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35
to the ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ¶ 61,266, the California ISO has developed a
procedure for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market
Participants.  

	Process

	The FERC Fee invoices will be issued to each market participant one
business day after the market and GMC invoices are distributed. The last
statement of the trade month will include the FERC Fee charges under CT 550.
A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and can be used to verify
metered load and export quantities.  

	To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data
showing that applicable load and export data was not associated with
transmission transactions over the ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting
exemption from the FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative
with the BAID, location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export
that are to be exempted. Any disputes concerning requested exemptions should
be raised in the ISO's settlement dispute process. The ISO will inform the
FERC of the total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO
Controlled Grid and the MWh exemptions requested by each Market Participants
for the FERC Fees.

	DUE DATES
	Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis for 
	a) entities with a current Approved Credit Rating or; 
	b) who maintain at the ISO a financial security posting at a level
sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation and 
	c) who are current on all obligations to ISO:
	For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an annual basis
and meet the requirements to make annual payments, the payment due date is
in accordance with tariff section 7.5.1.2.   

	For entities who do not meet the criteria set forth above, payment
is due 5 business days from the date of issuance of the monthly FERC Fee
invoice.

	Any SC payments received by the ISO will be held in an interest
bearing account.  Interest earnings will not be separately identified to the
benefit of individual Scheduling Coordinators.

	If you have any comments please contact your Account Manager.

It has come to our attention that confidential information was disclosed after the EWS PRC meeting this past Tuesday.  We are very concerned about any breach of confidentiality as it relates to discussions in our PRC meetings.

The PRC process is very important at Enron, and it is absolutely critical that confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.  It goes without saying that information discussed during a PRC meeting should never be shared outside the meeting.  The integrity of the entire PRC process is at risk if we cannot trust what is said in the room during a meeting will stay in the room.

The mid-year PRC process is still ongoing and many of you will be attending final Enron-wide meetings later this month.  The process is not complete until these final meetings are concluded, at which time individual feedback should be given.  That feedback should be summary information only specific to the individual.  Information should never be shared about others' ratings or specific comments made about a person.

Please see either one of us if you wish to discuss this further.

Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley

  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

When natural gas prices were sky high a year ago, the ""window looked wide open"" for the long awaited Alaska natural gas pipe, which would carry supplies from the North Slope to the Lower 48, but realistically, ""it's never been a slam dunk,"" said Ed Small, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates based in Canada. He also cautioned that producers will have to have the Alaskan government's blessing on the chosen route, or it would be a ""fatal flaw in the process."" 
Small, who will testify next week before the Alaska State Legislature's Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, said Thursday that instead of making it easier to build the pipe, politics seem to actually be making it more difficult now than ever before. Besides the political climate, which pits Alaska's elected leaders against Alberta's -- where the pipe would be laid under one proposal, Small also sees a two-fold problem on the supply side. 
""On the demand side, when high prices showed, demand went down, and probably will not come back like it did before,"" he said. ""The economy slowing down has helped in the perception of weakness and demand softness."" Of the predictions that the North American gas demand will reach 30 Tcf in the next 20 years, Small said that CERA analysts had ""never been a proponent of a 30 Tcf world, and now it's less plausible than probable."" That in itself will lower expectations of an Alaska pipeline, he said. 
Part of the demand problem is actually laying the pipe, and Small pointed to the infrastructure it will take, which he said will require no stopping once it really begins. ""If you overlay the reality of the world, to bring the kind of supply to make it worthwhile from Alaska would require a huge infrastructure, which I don't see happening by 2007. Maybe 2010, or maybe 2015, but it's just so huge."" 
The second part of the dilemma facing an Alaskan pipeline is the incredible growth in the liquefied natural gas market, which has seen an enormous amount of activity from both majors and independents since the beginning of this year (see related story). 
""LNG is going to be competition to Alaskan gas,"" Small said. ""The demand problem has brought out a lot of potential responses, and LNG is one of them. It has changed the landscape, and so it changes the outlook for the pipe."" While he said that the economics are actually comparable from Arctic gas and new greenfield LNG facilities, ""LNG can be different on a scale regarding the cost and it has more of an environmental footprint than a 3,500-mile gas pipeline."" 
However, not all of the LNG announcements made thus far will be completed, Small noted. ""As projects are announced, it's what's going to be built that puts the actual question into Arctic gas."" 
Despite what he called his ""realistic"" rather than ""negative"" attitude toward the pipe, Small said that laying it will be such a ""monumental undertaking that it may develop a life of its own regardless. The need for gas may be more than adequate to overcome any obstacles."" However, he cautioned that the obstacles were only getting higher. 
""Alaska has drawn a line in the sand, and without getting into the legality of that, what that does is set the tone,"" Small said of the Alaska legislature and Gov. Tony Knowles moving to ensure the pipe is built the way the state wants it built, regardless.  Meanwhile, Alberta also has sort of drawn a line in the sand, Small said, which is important, because at least one-third of the pipeline would move through the province. 
""From the sheer cost of it, it doesn't need any obstacles,"" he said. ""Those kinds of things are stumbling blocks."" Besides the government officials working to ensure they not upset constituents, Small said there also are the rights-of-way that have to be obtained and a lot of other work to be done behind the scenes. 
""At this juncture, it's in the producers hands, and they say they will make a decision by the end of the year, but I'm skeptical of that,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it won't be built. But if (the producers' route decision) is contrary to the Alaskan government, it may be a fatal flaw in the entire process."" 
The key, he said, is in the economies of scale. ""The bigger they make it, the more impact it will have on the market. A huge pipeline would have a huge impact on the market."" In his opinion, the total pipeline's capacity, which includes Alaska, the Mackenzie Delta supplies and any LNG facilities built, would be a ""maximum of 4 Bcf/d.""

Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Thanks for getting SCEM changed to MIRANT.  They started showing up right this morning.

How difficult is it to get them changed, and who all is affected by it?  I have a laundry list of codes that are cumbersome or confusing, and would like to see about changing a batch of them.  I will do all the leg work of finding out if certain ones are ok with everyone, but wanted your input and advice.

EPC Contracts
On June 17, 2001, Bechtel International, the contractor responsible for the construction of the Phase II Power Plant, and Lingtec Constructors, the contractor responsible for the construction of the LNG Facilities, terminated their respective construction contracts with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) due to non-payment.  Since that date, DPC has assumed control of the Phase II and LNG works and is presently undertaking pre-preservation activities.
DPC's Phase II construction permit expired as of June 30, 2001.  DPC's application for renewal is now pending with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).
LNG Vessel Construction

Construction of the LAKSHMI is proceeding on schedule, with 98% completion to date.  Sea and gas trials are scheduled to occur as planned later this summer, and delivery of the vessel is expected to occur on November 15, 2001.  Greenfield Shipping Company's lenders recently suspended further  credit facility funding.  Greenfield, its sponsors and the vessel lenders are presently discussing, among other things, funding issues relating to the remaining shipbuilding contract instalment that will become due on delivery of the vessel.

Hi Corry,

Since the new sheets are going to be a little more fussy, and the alias thing harder to fix or maintain, I would like to get the enpower short codes changed to things that are more workable and make sense.

See how these grab you:


AQUILACORP -- AQUILA (The canadian ones can stay long for differentiation)

DUKEENENTRA- DUKE (But is there another Duke that is just Duke already?)

MSCAPGP - MORGAN

EDISONMISIM - EDISON

IDACORPENE - IDACORP

PINNACLEWE - PINNACLE

AVISTAENE - AVISTA


I have a few west specific ones, but wanted to check with you for these.

Lemmie know.

Please find the following Action Items for the Tech Services team stemming from today's DASH review meeting with L. Kitchen.   Bob V. can you take point on this with  D. Williams.   Mike Coleman attended the meeting in Dan's absence and can provide feedback on some of the technical discussion.

1.	Please develop a project schedule showing the inter-relationship between permitting, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and start-up activities.  Key issues include:
	a)	ability to get equipment ordered and delivered given vendor availability
	b)	inter-play between equipment purchasing and off balance sheet financing requirements.
	c)	delay in construction caused by a delay in the air permit
	d)	securing a construction permit - given that site remediation has not been signed off on by the state/city
	e)	construction activities in the winter
	f)	other permits required

2.	Provide a review of the O&M budget and long term performance factors to ensure we are comfortable with cost and plant performance used in the pro forma.

3.	Provide an assessment of the cost/ability to put in place an EPC contract to meet the pro forma assumptions (labor rates in NYC, unions, RAC requirements, etc).


As we have discussed, we need to be proactive in the DASH process and conduct a technical review meeting before the DASH is written and circulated.   This will ensure that we have identified and have addressed/modeled/mitigated/reserved for technical issues before the DASH is submitted to EWS management for signature.  Our Thursday meetings are a perfect platform for getting these issues out on the table.   This did not occur in the case of Brooklyn Navy Yard, and we were left scrambling trying to answer technical questions in respect of the DASH.  Much of the analysis was done, however, we need to present a clear review of technical risks and mitigation impacts of the project.  Failing to do so puts the project at risk and creates doubt that Tech Services has a firm grasp of the Technical Risk in ENA.  If there are issues getting access to information or you are being left out of the technical analysis in compiling the DASH please let me help.

Brian

These are small points that are complicated and use transmission for the paths.  Here is the completed PSW sheet for your analysis.  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >>  What worked: Routing worked at Midway, which was a shaped hourly schedule, expressed as a shaped hourly schedule on the sheet. Craig routed, and So did Four Corners.  Path Confirmation: still took over an hour to run,  but data is populated in the system now.  Please see my notes below for what did not work. From my preliminary view, the data appears to be correct, but I am going to leave final determination of the usability of this format for the decision of Bill Williams III and our real time group.  I was able to do some sorting and things look really good. The speed of the sort and pulling up batch info looks great. What did not work: Routing: West Wing and Mead did not route,  I got errors on 46 rows ""Error: Invalid Routing Term Code"".  The Term Column says DAY.  Does this error message reflect some other error? Alias Tables: We seem to have a major disconnect between our original intention and what is going on here.  The original intention  is that if the scheduler sheet says ""PINW"" instead of ""PINNACLEWE"", the program will understand that and populate all schedules with PINW in  the proper counterparty of Pinnacle West in the Confirm View.  Right now, the sheet is omitting the paths without the ENPOWER long name, and using the aliases as counterparty names in the Path Confirmation VIEW.  The Path Confirmation View should give the Long Name that we see in Table Edit Field ""Counterparty"". The Alias list is to help schedulers not have to use really long and cryptic acronyms when dealing with multiple paths.  Please call me so that we can talk about this ,  it seems like we are totally not understanding each other here. Path Confirmation:  	1.Each time I ran my confirmation button, it took an hour, I would find an error, and run it again, it took another hour, I would see another error, and it took another 	hour.  3 hours to run one little sheet is no good.  	2. Path confirmation also omitted 4 schedules with the error of ""Invalid Variant Type Conversion"".  The common thread in all of these paths is that they are 	generated at one point, and have transmission deals, and end up at a different point.  All transmission deals are entered properly in the sheet. These are lines 12-14 	and line 35 in the attached sheet. 	3. The data that has populated into the Confirmation system has problems.   		A.  For each Counterparty,  we need to see the ENTIRE path.  Not just what is in the portion that the marketer has above or below them. 		B. The confirming of each path must be able to be done quickly.  Double clicking the path, waiting two minutes and then populating a name is too long. 		Currently in Lotus, the operator holds down the shift key, and mouse clicks on each path that is confirmed with the counterparty.  This puts a check by 		each line. The operator then clicks ""Confirm"" and the dialog box with the time stamp and field for name appears.  When the name is populated and the 		operator clicks ""OK""  each path is confirmed as a batch. 		C. The name that appears when I look up ""Party"" should be the long name that appears in the table edit field ""Counterparty"".  The phone number should 		also populate on that line, as well as the check box if it is checked. This is consistent with what we have now. The name that appears now is the Enpower 		short name or the alias. 	 Other functions will be evaluated tomorrow.  I have a meeting for the remainder of the day, but will be available tomorrow for some testing.  I have committments until 9 am or so.",0,0

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

FERC Settlement Developments
SoCal Ed. MOU/Plan B
The CPUC's New Rate Proposal

FERC Developments
FERC's publicly recognized autonomy regarding California power talks likely has a less public, less autonomous, role in determining the outcome of debated refunds.  The following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the California settlement negotiations:

The Bush Administration does have influence over what FERC decides -- especially now that Pat Wood and other Republicans are there. The influence is certainly not formal (as FERC is supposed to be an independent agency), but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the ""political lay of the land"" -- particularly regarding the positions of the White House.
Bush and Davis do not like each other (no surprise there). Communication between the Davis Administration, the White House and FERC is not free flowing. Interaction between FERC and White House is frequent -- but with Davis only on an as-needed basis. (Staff level contacts are more regular -- especially staff of the Democrat commissioners).
Administrative Law Judge C. Wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $1 B -- and the Commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends. This would be for October forward. Wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later.  
Wagner has also strongly advised FERC and Bush (as well as his top advisors) that they will have to put price caps on, stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue (even though those steps run afoul of the ""free market"" position of the Admin -- and his own members). He has a great deal of influence with Bush.  

MOU & Pan B
Late Thursday (7/12) Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the Edison MOU.  The new proposal (now ABXX 82) reduces the value of SoCal's transmission system to 2 times book value (the state had previously agreed to pay 2.3 times the book value, or $2.76B).  Given the dire financial condition of the Socal Edison's parent company (EIX), the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $420M already promised by EIX.  Assembly moderate Democrats led by Keeley and Hertzberg feel that a $4.5B generator refund, a profit from the State's sale of the SoCal transmission lines, and an additional $1B from a dedicated rate component are all distant, but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a SoCal bail-out.  Of course, two thirds of these suggestions require FERC approval.


PG&E predictably views the new proposal ""DOA"" because it is a less attractive model to be applied in their bankruptcy proceedings than the initial SoCal MOU.  Alternately, at least one of Edison's executives indicated that SCE was confident that there would be a legislative proposal flowing from the MOU that the utility would ultimately be able to accept. He went on to describe the contours of such a proposal: It has to ""make it look like Edison is getting hurt"" to counter consumer group criticism that it is a bailout. This would be accomplished by providing something less than the $3.8 billion in under-collections. He also noted that the tricky part would be picking the right percentage below 100% -- go too low, and the generators drag SCE into bankruptcy.

CPUC Rates
The PUC will likely publish shortly (in a matter of days) a new rate agreement giving the DWR first call over the utilities on any money available for purchasing power.  If this rate agreement leaves SoCal with too little cash to operate going forward, the likelihood will increase that SoCal will file for bankruptcy protection.  It does not appear that there is enough cash for purchasing power under the current structure for both DWR and SoCal to remain solvent; therefore, in order to save SoCal from bankruptcy, the legislation governing DWR's power purchases will likely have to be revised.

Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume. Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  In Preschedule Workspace: I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements. I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards. Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered. The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points. My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower ""short name"" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name.  In Path Confirmation The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable.  Yesterday I identified several problems: 1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp. 2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp. 3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line. Today, I am finding the following: 1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur. 2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys). 3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less. 4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet. 5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read. 6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'. 7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that. Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good.  I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks. Cara",0,0

Regarding the new issues with path confirmation, most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily.  Vish is already working on them.   Concerning the colors, there are three sets of colors representing market, supply and transmission.  I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking.  This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application. Regarding Pre-Schedule, adding print capability to the error log should be no problem.  Also, adding ""check for errors"" functionality will be done.   Concerning ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points""; I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips (either term or schedule) for a deal, but the strips have different delivery points.  The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use.  I will confirm this. We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name.  I may have both the code and description displayed.

The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'. 7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that. Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good.  I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks. Cara",0,0

IBIT was basically flat, reflecting only a $2.6 million increase over the prior year quarter.  The main drivers were increased gross margin due to wholesale sales at a higher price, offset by increased expenses (plant maintenance costs, energy efficiency expenditures, MMF Q1 catch-up, Power Cost Adjustment and GATX leasing portfolio termination fee).

I am Peter Freeman,a private financial consultant /Account portfolio manager of 
FUNDSWORTH LTD,Ipswich UK.And i Happen to have managed a particular account for 
a Resident Foreigner,here in the United Kingdom,who died Intestate, leaving in our care a 
sizable amount in a domicialliary United States Dollars Investment ACC. For some reason 
this client does not have an easily identifiable next of Kin have
made several enquiries to locate any of my clients relatives; immediate and 
extended, this has proved unsuccessful. 


Hence, I am contacting you. I need your assistance in securing the money and property left 
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance 
House here in the United Kingdom. The Finance House has already issued a Government 
Mandatory formalty notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated and 
this should expire within a month.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two 
years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the 
mandatory legalrequirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I now seek a 
Reliable and Trustworthy person,with your consent and perfect understanding, to 
present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account initially 
valued at Twenty One Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States 
Dollars, interest not inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you
(prefereably outside the United Kingdom Financial
Institutions or its Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and 
Otherwise.

All I require is your honest cooperation and confidence in me; which I know 
would not come easy. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate 
background that will protect you from any breach of the law. I would advise 
that you give this positive consideration and get back to me soon. I'll be flexible and 
considerate in the percentage share that will be given to you for your assistance. 

Upon receipt of your response I'll send to you my private number so that you can 
reach me for further discussion.

Subject:	DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.

NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access and its management from the department server, both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources.

Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, ""In response to our customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network.""

The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.

This letter might come to you as a surprise since we
have not had any previous correspondence nor met. This
is as a result of the helpless situation I found
myself into. I got your contact during my search for a
reliable, capable and trustworthy person that can
assist me in this darkest moment of my life.

I am a native of Liberia and I lost my father, mother
and two sisters with our family house during this
recent war raging in Liberia. I am alive writing you
now from Nigeria where I and other lucky victims who
escaped alive from the rebel attack are like refugees.
No house, no good food, no good job and I'm just getting
assistance from well meaning individuals and a couple
of Nigerians who came back from Liberia too.
Before my father's sudden death, he deposited a
consignment labelled as a personal effect of classified 
DOCUMENTS AND VALUEBLES.

But consealed in it is the sum of US$5000,000.00 (Five
Million US Dollars) in cash with a Private security
vault overseas, which he intended to use for Politics.
While my father was alive he explained to me that he
had such fund and had to keep it in a security company
abroad due to the unstable polity in Liberia and
considering that he is a politician, he would not want
the Government to seize the money if deposited into
the bank in Liberia. Now that he is late and am the
only surviving son, I am writing you to assist me
receive this money in your country, invest it in a
profitable business and help relocate me to join you
immediately. As a result of insecurity of life and
property here, I do not want to stay in Africa any
longer. You have my permission/authority to
have/collect 30% of the funds on receiving it, for
your timely assistance.

Please indicate your readiness to assist me
immediately so that all the information about this
fund will be passed to you immediately and we can
execute this transaction within seven working days.
Send to me immediately the following information:
1. Your full legal names including contact address
2. Your mobile telephone and fax numbers for easy
communication
3. Date of birth, sex and marital status for
documentation purposes.

As soon as I receive your call or reply mail I shall
give you further details on how and where to receive
the fund on my behalf. The legal documents will also
be sent to you immediately and I shall pass
instructions to the security company to contact you

--------NEWS_______________________

GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.

NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access and its management from the department server, both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources.

Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, ""In response to our customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network.""

The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.

DEPOSIT FORM,and he attached a strict clause to the
fund in bracket(PAY AS RECEIVED), where I am
residing under political assylum with my younger 
sister Juliet, my younger sister who is 17
years old.
Now the war in my country is over with the help of
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra
Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who
served under the former regime and now ask countries
to expel such person at the same time freeze their
account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note

is real and never a joke. My late father Chief Kamara
gave me the photocopies of the certificate of deposit
issued to me by BANK IN ABIDJAN on the date of
deposit, and 
he called me closer to his bed side before his call
to glory(R.I.P)that i should pray to god first,
before contacting any foreginer and he warned me
stricly that i should avoid afican men with their
greedy and evil mind since this is the only legacy we
are inheriting from him.SIR,this is for

GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.

NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access and its management from the department server, both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources.

Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, ""In response to our customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network.""

The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.

reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,THE 
NIGERIAN
NATIONAL
PETROLEUM COPORATION that MR KEN POWER died from an automobile 
accident.On
further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL 
and
all attempts to trace his NEXT OF KIN was friutless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR KEN POWER
did not declare any KIN OR RELATIONS IN ALL HIS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, 
INCLUDING
HIS BANK DEPOSIT PAPER WORK IN MY BANK. This sum of US$28,000,000.00 is
still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. NO PERSON WILL EVER COME FOWARD 
TO
CLAIM IT.According to NIGERIAN LAW, at the expiration of 5(FIVE) YEARS,
the money will revert to the ownership of the NIGERIAN FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT
IF NOBODY APPLIES TO CLAIM THE FUND.Consequently, my proposal is that I
WANT YOU TO STAND IN AS THE NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY OF THIS FUND. So 
that
the fruits of this old man?s labour will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials.What we are going to do is simple.You have
to provide the following
information.

1; YOUR FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS:
2: YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS:
3: YOUR BANKING INFORMATION:

We shall use these information to prepare DOCUMENTS AND 
AFFIDAVITS,THROUGH
AN ACCREDITED ATTORNEY REPRESENTING YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY 
OF
THIS FUND DEPOSIT.We shall need the services of the Attorney for the 
DRAFTING
AND NOTARISATION OF THE WILL,AND FOR OBTAINING ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTS 
AND
LETTER OF PROBATE/ADMINISTRATION IN YOUR FAVOUR FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE
FUND into an account you will provide.For your assistance, you will be 
adequately
compensated with 40%) of
the total sum. (55%) will be my own share while (5%) will be set aside 
to
cover any incidental expenses made both at home and abroad before 
conclusion
of this deal.This transaction is 100% risk free as the paper work will 
be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees 
the
successful execution.

Attn: My Dear, 
 
 Compliments, I barrister ABEL have decided to bestow this trust on you,
which I pray you will not ignore or betray. I appologise in advance for
any inconviniences this may cause you. 

I am Barrister ABEL UDOKA the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Richard K. William,
who was a contractor here in Benin Rep. And on the 3rd of Oct 2001, my client,
and his family were perished in a ghostly car accident along Midombo Togo
express way. As a matter of fact, my client made a fixed dopsit Amount,
valued at (USD$10.7M) with Legend Trust Bank here in Cotonou Benin Rep,
and upon the maturity time of their agreement, his bank started contacting
him but no response. Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
 the next of kin to the deceased  as his personal attorney, or have his
account confiscated after four years, as it is in the law of this country.

 
Since then, I have made several contacts to His Countries Embassy in order
to locate any of my clients extended relatives, which had also been unsuccessful.
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating  the relatives for over two years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since none of his relatives were no way to be found so that the proceeds
of this account valued at $10.7m could be transffered into your account,
thereafter, we will both share it in percentage according to our contributions
to boost the success of this great transaction. I have all the necessary
legal documents that can be used to back up all the claims we will make.

I know that you might be wonder why I have decided to trust you with this
huge sum, but the truth is that I need you to get this money out and considering
the fact that you are a foreigner which makes it a lot easier and straight
forward. 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us make this great benefiting
transaction successfully. I guarantee you that this will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of th law.
 
Please get in touch with me as fast as possible through my private :E-mail
address: barristerabeludoka@echina.com  or through phone to enable us discuss
further the progress of this business. 

With best regards, 

Hon: ABEL UDOKA Esq,

GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.

NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access and its management from the department server, both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources.

Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, ""In response to our customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network.""

The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.

Kate,
We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.  We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.  This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.  We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.

If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.

Thanks for the help.

Bill

Michelle,
 
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.  Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out. 
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.  
 
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.  They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them. 
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.

Met with the Team on Friday (713-01) to review the location and possible options for the Duke I/C at WT-1. The concern with the 4"" restriction and the 30 mm they want to flow on Sept. 1, and if we would be able to take it. 

Calculated the pressure drop through the 4"" valve with a worse case option of a 3"" hole that was hot tapped (4"" piping and valves is apx. 18"" in length and rest of I/C is 8"")  and the pressure drop at 30mm is 6 to 7 lbs. Duke has compression on this line and their pressure drop on the 8"" lateral is in the 40 lbs. range to the inlet of WT-1. With the proposed tie-in to the discharge side of the station later, and no more pressure drop that has been calculated on the suction side, we should be able to handle the additional volumes with the current set up. 

There are several options that can take place and we can evaluate once Duke has installed their scrubber. 
1) The existing piping from Duke's I/C is manifolded  with a 4"" to the inlet side of the scrubbers (current gas flow) and a 4"" to the outlet side of the scrubbers (currently closed). Once Duke installs their scrubber and it work satisfactory, the Team can open the 4"" on the outlet side of their scrubbers and have 2 (two) points for gas to flow on the  suction side of WT-1. 
2) If the proposed tie in to the discharge side develops, we can revisit another tie-in point for the suction side at that time and if Dukes scrubber performs satisfactory. With Dukes scrubber in place and in operation, it allows for open access to locations for a tie in, as most of the piping on the pre-scrubbers side at WT-1 is very congested. 

I would recommend that we leave I/C as is for now, if there are concerns or questions, please let me know. 

Thanks

EOG has been non responsive to our request for payment, (go figure).  I would suggest the team physically reduce the flow through the station to 10,000 mmbtu/d, in compliance with TW's operating parameters of requiring monitoring equipment for large volume stations, and continue to restrict the flow until the station complies with our standards.

I have also recently been informed by the TW commercial desk that they have decided to absorb the outstanding expenses to date, and will sponsor the cost for monitoring equipment and commercial power to assure the station complies with our requirements for volumes of this magnitude.  Could you reissue the latest W.O. and indicate that it is not reimbursable, but rather will be a marketing project?  This will clear your outstanding expenses and let us go forward with the station construction.

With regard to my other ""favorite company"" the team and planning are looking at a project to by-pass the 4"" restriction in the WT-1 compressor yard downstream of the new Duke interconnect.  They will be tendering about 30,000 /d the first of September and wont to be sure we be able to take the gas.

Thanks for your help Earl!

What's the latest of the EOG side of this interconnect. They have tied in two more well behind the I/C and did not tell the Team. The Team pulled the plate the other day and it was covered with black b.s., maybe glycol and very hard to clean the plate. 
The location still has the temp. EFM on it (TW's) and no gas quality that was required. 

Is EOG going to pay for the equipment as they stated to get the  I/C in service then back out on?????????????
Is this I/C going to be Shut in??????????????????????????????
It is getting to the critical stage, we have equipment requisitions and some received and lots of $$$$$$$$$$ hanging out. 
What is the next step with EOG??????????????

I know this is your favorite company to deal with and figured you needed some news to cheer you up.

Please let us know how to proceed on this I/C and what Marketing would like to be the next step on this project.

Thanks

IPPs Fall 1.9%   Last week our IPP composite fell 1.9%, underperforming both the NASDAQ (+4.0%) and the S&P 500 (+2.1%).  Calpine was the strongest performer in the group, rising 4.5%.  AES was the weakest performer, falling 9.5%.   2. 4 Items to Focus On   In our view, there were four items worth focusing on from last week: 1.) AES fell 10% owing to Latin American concerns.  We see downside to our 2001 estimate; 2.) The FERC settlement conference adjourned on July 9.  On July 12, the presiding ALJ issued a recommendation favorable to generators; 3.) On July 12, the US bankruptcy court approved Calpine's settlement with PG&E and, 4.) On July 10, NRG Energy announced it would acquire a 2,255 MW portfolio from Indeck. 3. Latin America Pressuring AES Earnings   The likelihood of downside to our 2001 EPS estimate for AES. Corp. of $1.89 has increased materially.  We believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the potential to negatively impact 2001 EPS by $0.25-$0.30 versus prior expectations-on a stand-alone basis.  While management indicated in mid-May that it could offset weakness in Brazil, the currency has materially depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the near-term.  AES's second quarter earnings conference call will take place on July 26.  Following the call, we will adjust our 2001 estimate accordingly, unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items through upside in other parts of its business. 4.  FERC ALJ Issues Report    On Thursday (7/12), Curtis Wagner, the Administrative Law Judge who presided over the recent settlement conference, issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps. Overall, the report was very much consistent with our expectations.  While Wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators, he argues that the $8.9 billion demanded by the State of California ""cannot be substantiated.""   We believe Calpine and Mirant offer the greatest downside protection from this issue.   5. CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference   On September 10 and 11, CSFB will host a Power Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  This event is designed to provide investors with a wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas companies, to equipment and construction service providers, to the power producers themselves.

Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign is kicking off this month.  As a pacesetter company in Houston, our campaign starts in mid-July with the leadership giving appeal followed by employee giving and participating in Day of Caring in early August.  

To ensure the success of the ETS campaign, we need employees throughout the organization to spread the word about the United Way and help with the logistics of running the campaign.  As a Campaigner, our employees would work closely with the ETS Communications group to drive a successful campaign.

I ask that you submit at least 3 names of Houston employees from your group to be Campaigners and help with this year's campaign. Each campaigner will be responsible for a group of Houston employees in their business unit.  We need, on average, 1 campaigner for every 20 employees.  

Can I get your list of Campaigners by Monday, July 16?

Additional information about this year's campaign will be coming soon.  

For now, please mark Thursday, July 26, from 3:30 - 4:30 on your calendar.  Stan will be hosting the ETS Leadership Giving reception and the ETS Management Team will be invited to attend.  Also, please mark Thursday, August 9, on your calendar for ETS' Day of Caring.

Please stay tuned for details about this year's Campaign and ETS' Day of Caring.

Thanks so much for your commitment to the United Way.

*  TW system:  a leaking valve has been identified as a contributor to the TW gain; the valve is on a station bypass line around station 9207 (receipt into TW system).  Problem has been corrected as of 7/10/01; we were not able to quantify leakage;  we'll have to wait until next month to note results of this find.  
* as a result of the Albq. Regional uaf mtg (7/12/01), arrangements are being made for audit teams to review all stations greater than 50,000 mcf/day.
*Participated/Witnessed a station assessment at NNG/Transok I/C at Roger Mills #1 compressor station, personnel from Energox conducted the assessment, I will share their information if provided.
* at the Albq Regional uaf mtg, the new PGAS balance report was reviewed for correctness; station 01086 (Duke/WT1 Interconnect-receipt station) was omitted from the June TW balance report; this correction will reduce gain

Subject:	proposed sitara report

Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe

Subject:	Robotrader/Autotrader

Savita,

Attached is the latest Robotrader spreadsheet.

As you may recall, we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again.

The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one.

Principles as follows:

- Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade
- Definitions
	- Intensity: Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions (the Intensity Factor)
	- Intensity Factor: The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity
	- Dead Interval: The period of time in which (if nothing occurs), an event or transaction is deemed to take place.
	- Offset Reversion Ratio: The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes
	- Spread Minimum: The minimum spread which can be used.
	- Offset Minimum: The minimum offset which may be used.
	- Spread-Offset Minimum: The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset
	- Spread Reversion Rate: The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes
	- Position Sensitivity: The position which, if exceeded, will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase
	- V-Factor adjust: The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Momentum: The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling
	- Adjusted Momentum: A Momentum number which may be boosted, causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Offset: The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs.
	- Spread: The difference between the bid and the offer
- General Principles and Mechanics
	- As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).
	- The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment
	- The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum
	- The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity
	- As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.
	- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease
	- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large
	- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.
	- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen
	- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.

SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are ""a lot of bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point.""  After such a long delay, he stated that, ""We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level.""  Also, the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; ""We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders.""

The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will be $27 to $28 M.

Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs.


	Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
	Q:  	Will SCE defer payment on the ""quids"" notes, which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it?
	A: 	Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 20 quarters.

	Q:	Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
	A:	These reports were ""speculation"" and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-�-vis DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated ""in a few weeks.""

	Prudential Questions to SoCal
	Q: 	What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
	A:	There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the 	Assembly (Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the Sher bill was ""less a matter of using Polanco"" and approaches the MOU ""from a different direction.""  SoCal indicated that ""people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are.""

	Q:	What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
	A:	SoCal responded that ""the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism.""  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

	Q:	Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU?
	A:	SoCal responded, ""yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness, we support.""  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As Burton said in the press today, ""Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay."")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
	Q:	Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
	A:	The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we ""think it's more of an option in the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal.""

	Q:	What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
	A:  	""We are highly focused on this.""  The spokesperson stated that if 	revenue is distributed in a manner ""that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These changes, this would be a very serious event.""

	Q:	Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
	A:	SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still in effect, according to SoCal).

Hi Louise, 

I have a comparison for the first two weeks of Q3.  It is still so early, of course, that it is hard to say much.  We are going to add June to this to make it a little more meaningful.  But this is the Q3 stuff alone.

Thanks!

I am a director in the market risk group who reports to David Port and Ted Murphy.  

Later this week, we will have a reporter from Risk magazine in our office to discuss various aspects of our risk management philosophy.  During the course of the discussion, he may observe confidential and proprietary information.  Do we have a standard legal confidentiality agreement for these situations?

The truth of that statement is evident as organized union protesters greet the first forum with placards calling on the Labor Department to issue a standard to protect workers and criticizing the scheduling of hearings. ""The issue isn't about whether we should deal with ergonomics injuries, it's about how we deal with them,"" Chao says. Pat Cleary of the National Association of Manufacturers says the best ergonomics approach is one based on more scientific research, more emphasis on best practices, and more clarity regarding what is and is not work-related. He urges the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a clearinghouse of best practices. Eric Frumin, health and safety director for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, testifies that ergonomic programs work for both employers and employees. Good ergonomics programs improve productivity, reduce medical and disability costs, and improve product quality, he says.  . . .

In the final package, union negotiators agree to adjustments in some benefit areas to free up resources for other benefits that the local deems essential to the membership, As a result, retirees will be paying somewhat more in health premium costs, and the short-term disability benefit and separation allowance are both now less generous.  An initial 3.25 percent general wage increase is retroactive to the June 1 effective date of the agreement with a further 3.25 percent next June and 3.75 percent in 2003. The job security provision. remains in the contract and will apply to all employees currently on the payroll. The provision assures employees with at least 10 years service, whose jobs are abolished, an alternative position at the same rate of pay. The language will not apply, however, to employees hired after ratification.  . . . Page A-3 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k8w3f6_ STUDY SHOWS HIGH REVERSAL RATE FOR PLAINTIFFS' EEO VICTORIES A disproportionate number of employment discrimination cases won at trial by plaintiffs are reversed on appeal when compared to cases won by defendants, according to a new report by two professors at Cornell University Law School. The study, by Theodore Eisenberg and Stewart Schwab, maintains that from 1988-1997, 43.61 percent of plaintiff trial victories were reversed in federal appeals courts, although only 5.8 percent of defense trial verdicts were overturned on appeal. The study also indicates that the gap between reversal rates of plaintiffs and defendants is larger for employment discrimination cases than any other category of cases, including civil prisoner cases. Speaking at a press conference to release the study, Schwab says, ""benign explanations for the large gap in reversals are hard to come by"" and argues that there is a ""nationwide, double standard"" when it comes to reviewing claims brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The study was commissioned by two law firms that represent employment discrimination plaintiffs. . . . Page A-2 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4k9n2t1_ COURT SAYS YAHOO! MUST REVEAL TO COMPANY IDENTITY OF ANONYMOUS POSTER An Internet service provider must disclose to a New Jersey biopharmaceutical company the name of an anonymous Internet user who, describing herself as a ""worried employee,"" posted confidential information about the employer on the ISP's finance message board, the New Jersey Superior Court rules (""Immunomedics Inc. v. Jean Doe, a/k/a ""moonshine _fr,"" ""N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.,  No. A-2762-00T1,  7/11/01). Although anonymous Internet speech ordinarily is protected under the U.S. and New Jersey Constitutions, there was sufficient evidence that plaintiff Jean Doe compromised that right by breaching Immunomedics Inc.'s employee confidentiality agreement by posting the messages, Judge Fall decides. In a separate case decided the same day, Fall affirms a trial court's refusal to grant a similar motion requiring Yahoo! to disclose to Dendrite International Inc. the identity of an anonymous Internet user who posted allegedly defamatory statements about that company's financial dealings. Dendrite failed to show that the unidentified Internet user--who may or may not have been a Dendrite employee--posted any information that harmed the company, the court ruled (""Dendrite Int'l Inc. v.

BRAZIL
Summary
Defining Brazilian Central Bank's crisis strategy: Facing dilemma of raising rates decisively now or holding fire while waiting on Argy; real can wait
IMF and US Treasury: still behind Brazil, behind the scenes, while giving Argentina an opportunity to extricate itself from its current problems
Fraga will seek to avoid repeat of last month's mistakes: will not weaken a large rate rise with easing bias again; will not give market new targets to bet against 

Report
Some arguing a decisive pre-emptive raise - as much as 675bp to 25% by central bank.  In light of the unsettled situation in Argentina and market response to Turkey's 400bp increase (met with continued selling pressure: lira set new lows, bonds down) there may be a move to conserve ammunition in case of a Argentina-induced external shock.  Despite breaking through 2.6BRR/$, the real held and rallied today.  Wait-and-see approach may be chosen on fears of a challenge to a rate rise fueling an upward rate spiral amidst further real depreciation. Central bank not expected to hold interventions to $50 mil./day, particularly if there are further problems in Argy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

ARGENTINA
Summary
Domestic politics continues to drive near-term outcome 
Cavallo continues to freelance, yielding uncertainty at home and abroad
Latest trial balloons focus on prepayment of taxes by banks and privatized companies
Letes swap talk still swirling
Next Letes auction scheduled for next Tuesday (7/24), something has give
Endgames: political compromise and/or Letes swap; tax prepay compromise; Cavallo going to international bankers for 'non-confrontational', voluntary restructuring; (if Cavallo goes) 'confrontational' default and/or breaking of convertibility peg

Report
If resolution does not come before Friday (both political and on Letes swap), expect a very long weekend in Buenos Aires as G-8 leaders meet in Genoa.
For now, holding pattern continues as no news is the news.  Latest figures from the central bank (from Thursday) show continued hemorrhaging of foreign reserves.  Capital flight is a key risk factor in the pace of crisis.  FRB debt trading below August 1998 lows.  Despite hue and cry of contagion fears, debt markets outside of Argy still holding up.  Wall St., Pennsylvania Ave. (WH and UST), and IMF still on the same talking points about rhetorical support but no new funds committed.  Even in the currency channel the resilience of the Mexican peso, Chilean peso has been notable.  In Brazil, the real continues to bear the brunt of the assault, but the steepness of the slide has attenuated.  Further evidence of 'Brazil-as-defensible' line from the investment community in concert with behind the scenes IMF and governments support.
 
Opposition political (Peronist) leadership and several provincial governors have yet to lend support for President De La Rua's austerity plan.  Despite repeated expectations of agreement from Friday evening on, the Peronist governors have stalled, arguing that they cannot commit until the governing coalition has agreed its plan between its partners.  Alfonsin and leftwing Radicals and junior coalition Frepaso party continue to seek adjustments to the De La Rua-Cavallo austerity package in order to protect their working class and lower middle class bases.  Rhetoric continues to reinforce nationalist populist imperatives.

Cavallo's team started spreading the rumor in Argentina that the US was going to help (e.g., telling friends about Cavallo's call to Condi Rice), hoping to spur confidence; instead forced the US to deny it.  Bush's letter to De La Rua offered little more than to say that our prayers are with Argentina.  A national unity government might not include Cavallo if Alfonsin and leftwing of Radical party gains sway in negotiations.

The economic team is initiating conversations with the privatized companies (including utilities) and banks in order to push them to pay next year's taxes in advance.  The goal is to collect $2 bil.  This number will cover the estimated deficit for the 2H01 ($1.5bil.).  The banks should advance $1 bil., and the privatized companies another $1 bil.  Repsol has already agreed to advance $150 mil.  Cavallo talked personally with the Presidents of the Spanish companies  (Telef�nica, Telecom, Endesa, etc.) and some Italians.  If successful, these collections will improve this year's numbers and would satisfy Alfonsin and the left wing by allowing normal social spending.

Repeat of drip, drip of market information ala May-June 'mega-swap'.  Goal: swap $4.8 bil. in 91-day debt still to be auctioned during remainder of 2001 into a 1-year bond, a structured product for domestic pension funds, and/or special mutual funds.  Details promised by Wednesday.  Optics tied to political bargaining.  Last Letes auction though fully funded to $800+ mil. goal was not oversubscribed as usual and primary dealers unable to pass it along.

Good Morning,

I will create another test day to look at all these changes, my target date is June 21.  

I will need routing records removed from the following points for that day:

MidColumbia

Please let me know when these routes are cleared and I will start re-populating data.  It will take me an hour or so to create the new spreadsheets for that day.

Cara / Corry,

I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation.  Included in the new release are...

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors.
Now able to print Error Log.
Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
'Get  Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable

Path Confirmation:
�	Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid
�	""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed
�	Enpower counterparty long names are shown 
�	Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog
�	Provided an option confirm the paths in batches,  
�	Path cut check box indicator is fixed

She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say ""Enron OnLine"" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.   Please call me with any comments at 37007.",0,0

After saying this so you will know Transwestern ordered the material and most of it is in our warehouse in Roswell so we'll need to talk about this.  I didn't know about the material when you and I talked yesterday morning.

Material's that will be needed at the location to monitor and operate the facility. 

1.  Chromagraph
2.  H2O Monitor
3. H2s Monitor
4. EFM
5. Flow Control
6. Positive Shut In 
7. Flow Bypass
8. Power to facility

People that will be attending from Transwestern, Rich Jolly, Earl Chanley, Laura Kunkel (maybe), and the some of the Carlsbad team members.

Thanks for working with us on this.

I've left messages over the past month for several people in Legal, but have received no response; hence this message to you in hopes you can direct me to who I should be talking to.

I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including EPMI, for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.

Of course this isn't something that keeps me up at night, but I would like to understand the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,

Cara / Corry,

I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation.  Included in the new release are...

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors.
Now able to print Error Log.
Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
'Get  Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable

Path Confirmation:
�	Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid
�	""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed
�	Enpower counterparty long names are shown 
�	Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog
�	Provided an option confirm the paths in batches,  
�	Path cut check box indicator is fixed

*. The state budget passed the Assembly last night at approximately 6:55 p.m. PDT.  The MOU hearing, which was supposed to take place following the budget debate, was cancelled due to the late hour.  The Senate is on call to take up the budget (SB 739 [Peace]).  There are rumors that Senator Burton will not accept the large amount of pork put into the budget by the Assembly.  The budget must pass both houses before the legislature can adjourn, so it takes priority over the MOU.

*. The Senate Energy Committee is on call of the chair (Bowen) to discuss the original MOU, sponsored by Polanco.  This is expected to happen sometime today.

*. An Assembly vote on AB 82XX is likely to occur in its floor session on Wednesday or Thursday.  An Assembly floor session is scheduled for Friday on the call of the Speaker.

*. Two Republican votes are now needed to pass any urgency measure or the budget on the Senate side because Senator Kuehl (Dem) has gone on vacation to Italy.  Sen. Perata (Dem) may also go on vacation shortly, meaning that 3 Republican votes would be needed.

(i)	If an Early Termination Date is designated, the Defaulting Party shall compensate the Non-Defaulting Party for the Loss, if any, caused the Non-Defaulting Party with respect to each Terminated Product.  The amount of a Loss shall be determined by reference to (i) the prices available within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date in an arm's length transaction for a replacement product, or (ii) the price agreed in a cover transaction effected within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date.  No actual purchase or sale shall be required in order to determine a Loss.  Any cover transaction shall be effected in a reasonable manner and on the best available terms.  In no event shall the Non-Defaulting Party be required to use its own market position in order to effect a cover transaction.         
(ii)	If the Non-Defaulting Party has suffered Loss, the sum of such Loss shall be payable to the Non-Defaulting Party by the Defaulting Party on the date specified in Section 5.5.  The amount payable by a Party pursuant to this Section 5.4(ii) shall be the ""Termination Payment"".

""Loss"" means an amount equal to the difference between the present value of the Contract Price for the remaining Term and the present value of the cost for a replacement product.  With respect to the Buyer, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is higher than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.  With respect to the Seller, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is lower than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.  
This takes the place of the present 5.4(i)-(ii), and the definition of Gain is deleted.

Hi Louise,  

As a followup from yesterday, this spreadsheet contains a comparison from June 1 - mid July.  The Q3 comparison from yesterday only contains two weeks of data, so this might give a more meaningful comparison.

Although the contract with Adventis has been terminated by D.Cox via telephone, Partha Ghosh continues to try to facilitate the AT&T - Enron relationship.  

I continue to believe that there is no reason that you can not have a direct relationship with Dave Dorman to pursue opportunities at a high level.  I have always encouraged a direct call from you to D.Dorman to find out if we can wean ourselves from Adventis.

I understand that you have a call scheduled today with D.Dorman I would like to take the opportunity to get a gut check on the previous deal if you think it is appropriate.



Talking Points:


Previous Deals Proposed

We previously proposed a transaction to establish a JV which would pursue the wholesale intermediation market for long haul bandwidth (see attached draft).

You seemed interested in our proposal but we have had difficulty in getting a follow up meeting to confirm your interest and get your thoughts on the proposal.

In the meantime, through Adventis, we proposed a different structure where AT&T would buy Enron's longhaul network and in exchange Enron would take back a take or pay (see attached draft).  In our view, it's really the same deal but instead of AT&T receiving value through an equity interest in a JV, AT&T would receive value through the take of pay.  The deal really accomplishes the same thing for us.


The Strategy Behind the Deals Proposed

EBS is really an acquisition for Enron that came with the purchase of Portland General Electric.  The communications company of PGE was going down the road of all of the other fiber over builders in the marketplace in that it intended to build out its own network.

We have repositioning that company over the last 12 - 18 months so that it fits better with the Enron business model of trading and intermediation.  Part of this process likely includes reducing of most of out long haul positions to better facilitate intermediating the long haul market as opposed to  build, own and operate in it. The deals proposed to AT&T would assist accomplish this repositioning of EBS.

Future Communications

Previously we have spent much of our time communicating to you through Adventis.  This has been a challenging process for us.  Is it possible to establish a direct high level relationship with AT&T especially at the President (D.Dorman) to CEO (J.Skilling) level.

RJ

The former bill carrying the original MOU, SB 78XX (Polanco), has now
been gutted and replaced with what appears to be the Senate plan (crafted by Sher) for the MOU.  IN other words, the original MOU crafted by the governor and SoCal in April no longer has a bill carrying it.

*. The newly amended SB 78XX calls for the following:

- There is an option for the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at book value.
- Revenue from the rate stabilization bonds may be used as follows:
	- No more than $1.2 billion for bank creditors
	- No more than $1.3 billion for debts owed to QFs
	- Any debts for power purchased from non-QF generators before 1/31/01 is the responsibility of SoCal and its parent company.

*. This deal seems very likely to be seen as unacceptable by SoCal,
especially this final point.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

PreSchedule:
1.  Concerning the path with transmission data...  The original format was based off of Corry's suggestion.  Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs.  However, I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission, otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR, POD and firmness for the transmission deal. 

2.  Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points?

3.  We will resolve the physical / non-physical in the next release, as well as add a ""Check for Errors"" button.

4.  Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming.  We will work on it right away, but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data.  We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible.

Path Confirm:
1.  Sorting...  Are Global ID and Tag sorting, just not in an order that you expect?  Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons.  If you need the values sorted by numbers, putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you.

2.  Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes?

3.  I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market.  If the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.


Again, thanks for your testing efforts.  We have come a long way due to your diligence.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123""  show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

Sources suggest they need some form of MOU to pass at least one chamber of the California legislature in order to show at least a  little momentum to creditors.  The legislature appears commited to closing the session for a one month recess on Thursday night and is currently sorting through three bailout plans and the state budget.  Senate Republicans appear to remain opposed to all three bailout plans, meaning that at best, any bailout plan would pass on a non-emergency basis with a 90 day delay for implementation.

Call if you have questions.

RJ x39934

1.	AB82xx and AB83xx--Dueling Bailouts

Expect another lively day in California.  Two bills will be heard in committee at 10am Sacramento time--AB82xx and AB83xx.  AB82xx we tipped you about on Friday--the 80 page ""tough medicine"" bill for SoCal sponsored by Speaker Hertzberg.  AB83xx is sponsored by Rod Wright, Chairman of the Utility committee and a moderate Republican Keith Richman.  AB83xx is much more generous to SoCal and indeed Wright calls it a ""straight bailout with nothing hidden.""

2.	Budget Bill and Imminent Legislative Recess Could Sidetrack Both Bills
On top of this dynamic is the Budget Bill and the State Senate. According to my contacts, Senator Burton, the Senate President, is hoping to keep the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening. Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison issue is resolved. But talk is that once they recess, whether on Thursday or not, they plan to adjourn the Second Extraordinary session, meaning all xx bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days, and all others will be dead. 
As for the Budget, it is unlikely that Sen. Burton will recess the Senate on Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last night. However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, is in Italy and she has a 16 hour flight to return. No one knows if she has been told to return yet. Her vote is crucial to passage of the Budget, though, and she will be needed if they take that bill up tomorrow or Thursday. 
3.	A Third MOU Proposal?
Also, the Sen. Byron Sher proposal for Edison has still not been seen in print, but most people expect it to appear tomorrow, so the Senate can vote on it tomorrow or Thursday. It is likely to receive a waiver to hold an impromptu Senate Energy Committee hearing off the Floor on the , since no Energy committee hearing has been scheduled. This is the proposal that Sen. Burton has said he favors and is seen as the least like a bailout of any current proposals. 
4.	""Price Manipulation"" Committee to Meet Today
The one Senate committee that is scheduled to meet tomorrow is the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market - at 9:30 AM -- which is scheduled to review compliance with subpoenas for Duke, Reliant, AES, NRG and Williams. (Interestingly, the hearing notice does not mention Enron, which the committee charged with contempt.)

The risks inherent in enacting legislation (H.R. 2269) that would allow employers to give employees access to investment advice are outweighed by the need for increased access and offset by safeguards to protect employees, says John Boehner (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee and sponsor of the Retirement Security Advice Act. Ann Combs, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits, calls providing increased access to investment advice a critical issue and says the Labor Department supports the proposed amendments to ERISA. Committee Democrats argue for expansion of safeguards to protect employees and prevent abuses, while the AFL-CIO says the bill would expose employees to the risk of being steered toward high-fee investment products and could exacerbate Section 401(k) losses. . . . Page AA-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4m2h6x4_ COURT REJECTS TRUCK DRIVERS' SUIT  ALLEGING WAGE SKIMMING BY EMPLOYER A group of Illinois truck drivers failed to show that their employer breached its collective bargaining contract with their union by skimming funds from their wages, the Seventh Circuit rules, affirming a lower court's series of judgments for the employer (""McLeod v. Arrow Marine Transport, ""7th Cir.,  No. 01-1060,  7/12/01). The drivers could not prevail on their hybrid breach of contract and duty of fair representation claim under Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act against Arrow Marine Transport Inc. unless they first could establish that their union was not representing them fairly, Judge Bauer explains. Finding that the drivers did not show that the Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Union Local No. 301 breached its duty of fair representation by failing to uncover the alleged wage-skimming scheme, the court affirms the trial court's decision to grant the company summary judgment as to claims brought by three of the plaintiffs and to dismiss the claims of five other drivers. . . . Page A-8 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4m2k2v0_ NINTH CIRCUIT REVIVES 'EFFEMINATE' RESTAURANT WORKER'S HARASSMENT CLAIM A restaurant employee who allegedly was sexually harassed because he was too effeminate should be able to take his claim to trial under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Ninth Circuit rules (""Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enter. Inc., ""9th Cir., No. 99-35579, 7/16/01). Reversing summary judgment granted by the  U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington to Azteca Restaurant Enterprises, the appeals court rules that Antonio Sanchez's sexual harassment claims under Title VII and the Washington Law Against Discrimination should survive because he was singled out for harassment by male co-workers and a supervisor who considered him feminine and believed he did not meet their views of a male stereotype.  Judges Gould and Reinhardt find that while Azteca did have a sexual harassment policy in place and exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment, its response to Sanchez's complaints was not sufficiently prompt to avoid liability. Dissenting on the issue of vicarious liability, Judge Wardlaw argues that Azteca's response was appropriate, and Sanchez's failure to report further harassment to management made him partly responsible for the company's inaction. . . . Page A-2 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4m1x7q8_ KMART VIOLATED ERISA IN USING WRONG INTEREST RATE, SAYS COURT Kmart Corp. violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act when it computed lump-sum pension plan distributions using the wrong interest rate, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois rules (""Tullock v. Kmart Corp. Employee Pension Plan, ""S.D. Ill., No. 99-CV-0289-DRH, 6/29/01). Judge Herndon finds that the retailer used the incorrect ""GATT rate"" in computing the lump-sum distributions by using the January 1997 rate of 6.83 percent rather than the 1998 rate of 5.81 percent. Kmart alleged that the January 1997 rate was the appropriate one because, although the lump-sum distribution checks were dated Feb. 1, 1998, the checks were sent out on Jan. 31, 1998.  Kmart cannot ""alter the fact that the checks were dated and thus distributed on February 1, 1998 by claiming that it has discretion to determine what the word 'distribution' means,"" Herndon writes. . . . Page A-6 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4m1j1d3_  WILHELM SAYS HERE NEEDS UNIFIED STANCE IN FACE OF HOTEL CONSOLIDATIONS As the hotel industry in North America continues to consolidate under fewer and fewer major corporate owners, the union that represents hotel workers must present a more unified stance in negotiations, perhaps even coordinating contracts so that individual locals can negotiate jointly with the major hotel chains, John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees says. HERE should set minimum goals for all contracts, make card check neutrality a demand in all negotiations, and coordinate campaigns against the major chains, the number of which has dwindled steadily from about 18 as recently as 1995 to only eight today--with still more consolidation likely in the next few years--Wilhelm tells union members attending HERE's convention in Los Angeles.  To counter that trend, HERE must ""knit together"" a unified union, while not losing the vitality of its various locals, Wilhelm says in his keynote address. . . . Page C-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4m2f0x8_ SMOKE-SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE  CAN PROCEED IN ADA RETALIATION CLAIM A smoke-sensitive employee who was discharged after she failed to report to work in a newly smoke-free office building can proceed with a retaliation claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fourth Circuit holds (""Rhoads v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., ""4th Cir., No. 98-2374, 7/12/01). Reversing a district court in Baltimore, the appeals court says Lori Rhoads, a former financial analyst at a failed Maryland bank, had provided enough evidence that her discharge--for excessive unexcused absenteeism--was illegal retaliation under the ADA. The Fourth Circuit reinstates the claim against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in its capacity as a receiver for Standard Federal Savings Bank and its successor institution, Standard Federal Savings Association.  However, the court affirms summary judgment for the employer on Rhoads's claim that the bank failed to reasonably accommodate her disability under the ADA and on her claim that the bank violated the Family and Medical Leave Act. . . .

I understand that there's a lot of discussion going on about the approach to organizing our technical resources.  I would appreciate the opportunity to provide input to that process.

You don't know much about me, but I have been with Enron for over eleven years.  I was hired Enron Power Corp. as Project Engineering Manager for the Teesside project, was promoted to General Manager of Engineering concurrently with being Teesside PEM, and built up the engineering group there.  I moved into front end development support and have worked on development projects in Mexico, South America, the Middle East and Europe.  A little over three years ago I was assigned to support ENA efforts and I was intimately involved in the 99 peakers on.  Last November I transitioned my EE&CC development engineering group from EE&CC to ENA as part of the Technical Services group.

All of the above is only to say that I have pretty broad exposure to the overall organization.  I know a lot of the people, a lot of the history and I a little about how this machine seems to work.  I would be happy to give my perspective on the issues if it is any value to you.  Although I should provide truth in advertising and warn you that I am pretty direct and have fairly definitive opinions on most subjects.  In other words, my opinion is way too easy to get.

If I can add anything to the process, please let me know.

Please forgive this interruption to your business day, but I thought it might be time I owned up before you found out from someone else.

B. I stole your slides and re-used them for my own purposes.  I hope you don't mind.

C. I think I can see how to move forward with our technology team to build the kind of systems ""structure"" that goes some way to mimicking the capabilities inherent in your new business structure. 

I thought you might enjoy thumbing through ""my"" slides and notes.

Then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for ""transmission.""  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for ""Tag"" and ""Oasis"" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Good Morning,

Did you read Will's last note?  Anyway, I am wanting to do one of two things and need to know which you like better.

The name and oasis number representation for tranny is not enough info for us.  We need POR and POD information as well. So,  I need the following capability

Either  

Put the transmission path in the E cell like we do now,

or

Put more information in the Trans name  ( ie:  APS-(T)PV/WW)  and in the OASIS cell  (ie:  23055 HNF)


Do you have a preference?  

We also need to be a united front about the design and intent of the Path Cut. They are not wanting to make it work all the way. I sure don't remember the conversations being that it should be just a replacement for the notes part, but because it's enpower everything should work together.  Am I on crack?


Thanks,

Attached is a file containing the following information for your management meeting in Beaver Creek (August 16-19, 2001):
	Preliminary Agenda
	Cost Estimate
	Outside Speaker Options
I am holding 3 Enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate.
I have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists.  The only one that I would not recommend is Joe Malarkey.  I thought his material was 'pure malarkey' - but that is just my opinion.  I have bios if you would like to see them.  We are not limited to this list - I can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
Statement File Specification (V13.1)

A new software release will be deployed to the Settlement System today.  

This software to integrate the A/S Soft Price Cap scheme into the
settlements system and eliminate manual work.  This release will take effect
with trade date 5/29/01. 

Please refer to the Market Communication concerning Statement File
Specification (V13.1) - ""Soft Price Cap for Ancillary Services"" dated July
10, 2001.


A more detail explanation of the changes is described in the attached
document.


Soft Price Cap for Ancillary Services 

Problem Description
Last December, ISO implemented the Soft Price Cap scheme that established a
soft price cap for both energy and Ancillary Services (A/S).  Bids above the
soft cap, if accepted, would be paid as bid (subject to review and refund),
but would not be able to set the Market Clearing Price (MCP).  The soft cap
was set to $250 initially and then changed to $150 in January.  In the
subsequent FERC Orders dated 4/25 and 6/19, FERC has established new price
mitigation schemes.  However, the underlying mechanism of the soft price cap
scheme has remained the very much similar.  The only difference is that the
soft cap becomes a more dynamic number under the more recent schemes.
The soft price cap for energy is processed automatically by ISO's Settlement
System.  For A/S, a manual process is being used.  When an A/S bid at above
the mitigated price cap is accepted, it receives two payments: one at MCP
and another that accounts for the difference between the bid price and MCP.
Currently, this surplus payment is calculated manually and appears as a
manual adjustment in the SC's statement file.  The corresponding allocation
of such surplus payments to the market also appears as manual adjustments in
the other SCs' statement files.  The manual process is labor intensive, more
prone to error and creates a large number of manual adjustments that are
difficult to track.


Proposed Solution

ISO plans to automate A/S Soft Price Cap scheme.  Once automated, the
accepted A/S bids will receive only one payment whose price is the higher of
the bid price and Market Clearing Price.  No manual adjustments will be
needed.  The entire payment will appear in the Day Ahead Ancillary Services
Due SC payments (charge types 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) or Hour Ahead Ancillary
Services Due SC payments (charge types 51, 52, 54, 55 and 56).

The Ancillary Services cost allocation (charge types 111,112,114,115 and
116) will be calculated using a weighed average prices for the service
instead of the MCPs.



Settlement Calculations

For Day Ahead (DA) A/S Due SC payments, the price will be given by:
Price = max (Bid Price, DA Zonal MCP of given service)

Similarly, for Hour Ahead (HA) A/S Due SC payments,
Price = max (Bid Price, HA Zonal MCP of given service)

For A/S Cost Allocation, the unit price of A/S obligation is currently
determined as follows:
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAMCP + HAQ*HAMCP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAQ = DA procurement target in the subject DA Region
HAQ = Incremental HA procurement target in the zones that make up the DA
region
DAMCP = MCP of the subject service in the DA region
HAMCP = Weighted average MCP of the subject service in the zones that make
up the DA region

Under the new scheme, the MCP terms in the above equation will be replaced
by average procurement costs.  Thus,
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAP + HAQ*HAP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the DA region
HAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the zones that
make up the DA region



Settlement Statements

There is no change to the settlement files structure.  The meaning of
several fields in the Ancillary Services Detail File have been modified
slightly.  These changes are explained in the latest  ISO Settlement
Statement Files Specification - Version 13.1.



Implementation Timelines

The change described above will take place in the Settlement Statements
beginning with trade date 5/29/2001, on which the FERC price mitigation
scheme (as described in the FERC 4/25 Order) took effect.

Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter merit mention: *	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week. *	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers (without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged. *	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the United States. *	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location. *	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production. Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing so on or about July 30. Thank you for your courtesies in these matters. Sincerely, Michael E.

Over the last 2 days, the company has announced a number of significant power sales agreements associated with its Texas capacity. 2) On July 17, CPN announced that it had entered into 2 agreements with Reliant Energy services to provide 1,000 MW of power over a 5 year period. On July 18, CPN announced an agreement with Shell Oil to provide up to 3,000 MW of power, also over a 5 year period.  All the contracts commence on January 1, 2002, which coincides with the beginning of retail competition in Texas. 3) Other details relating to pricing and contract structure were not disclosed. 4) In Texas, CPN currently owns 2,337 MW capacity in operation, 3,786 MW under construction and 1,007 MW under development. 5) Importantly, as a result of these announcements and other recent agreements, Calpine's Texas capacity is now 85% sold forward for the next 2 years.  Overall, this hedged position gives us additional comfort in CPN's ability to meet or exceed our 2001-2003 EPS estimates of $1.94, $2.35 and $3.08, respectively. 6) Some investors have expressed concern about Calpine's exposure to potential overbuilding in the Texas market.  CPN's recent contract announcements should reassure investors that the company is actively taking steps to manage and minimize its market price risk in this region.

Thanks for taking time Friday to meet with us......Sorry I missed you but I agree the meeting did go well.....I think you were successful in helping Michael Lynch over his hurdle concerning transport and gas supply which you rightfully point out are two distinct and separate issues.

I appreciate Stephanie Millers role in assisting our group in identifying obstacles and solutions in our development effort.  I hope you are not thinking of redirecting her.  She works well with our group.

With regard to Longview, lets coordinate the Gas Services Agreements through our development group.  I would prefer not to send McCook any further documentation until they have responded to our PSA and Management Agreements.  McCook is good at making us work and never responding. They owe us some Good Faith if you know what I mean.

I would appreciate it if you would continue to respond to McCooks questions about transport and supply...It sould like they need to get into an open season at the right time and you have a much better feel for that timing that I do.

Regards,
Jake

Jake, sorry I missed you on Friday. I took off around 4:00 and assumed you were tied up with MCCook.  If you have time today, give me a call.

If there is any chance that these guys are going to buy the plant, then they really need to get into the open seasons with Williams and PGT.... timing is everything. 

I also would like to discuss Stephanie Millers future role in the development game and would like your direct feedback. 

Thanks for having us at the meeting, I thought it went OK, but there really were two seperate agenda's and they were as much concerned about the price of their gas as they were interested in how it is going to get to the plant... and as you know, one doesn't really have to do with the other.

I pulled several comments you made out, and dittos from here.

I agree with your following statements:

	Even though this path could be consolidated to be smaller, we have many paths that are a good deal longer.  The part of the path in blue is in the 	upstream cell and seems to be the holdup. The size limit of the path needs to be considerably larger, or we need a way to override that for exceptionally 	long paths. I made the path smaller and got the same error.

I notice that when we have values in the transmission cells, the big E is not on there. Enron needs to be shown as ""bookends"" on the transmission we use, or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale.

Some really long paths might show better in line view if that could auto-size vertically

When I try to cut a particlar path, the action of the entire Path Cut screen coming up and then me having to choose New Path cut totally blocks my view of the existing path I am trying to deal with. I think instead this should pop up as an addition to the expanded view of the existing deal. I should be able to cut a path without having to deal with the whole sort menu.


I absolutely agree with the following:
	Region should be a button list that is driven only by the East or West designation of the person's Enpower Login.  As a West User, I should only get 5 choices for 	Region: WSCC-N, WSCC-S, Rockies, MidC, or California. The drop down list is time consuming,  confusing and can lead to too many errors.

	Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

It now appears less likely that El Paso Natural Gas will be placing new bi-directional gas transportation capacity between Daggett, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, to facilitate increased in-state California transportation options. The pipeline intended to use portions of the converted All American pipeline to increase capacity between the two major western market locations, but a binding open season revealed insufficient market interest, El Paso said in a bulletin board notice. 
The bidding process closed July 10 for the two postings of Line 1903 capacity. El Paso said it rejected all of the bids that were received on capacity offer No. 19420, which proposed firm transportation service from receipt points near Daggett to delivery points near Ehrenberg because there were insufficient volume and term commitments as required to economically justify going forward with the Line 1903 project. Additionally, no bids were received on offer No. 19418, which proposed firm transportation service from receipt points located near Ehrenberg to delivery points located near Daggett. 
El Paso held the binding open seasons for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the bi-directional lateral. In its previous non-binding open season May 1-25, El Paso said it received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and more than 0.9 Bcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. It was offering to build capacity capable of transporting 500 MMcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and 400 MMcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. For both the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett paths, El Paso was offering a reservation rate of no greater than 10 cents/Mcf on a 100% load factor basis and was estimating a fuel charge for both paths of 1.5%. 
If the open seasons resulted in sufficient binding transportation agreements to make the lateral project economically viable, El Paso planned file with FERC with a goal of placing the project in service during the first quarter of 2003. El Paso said it will reevaluate the results to determine if there is enough interest to justify moving forward in some fashion with a project.

Descriptions of each transaction follow (in blue) below the respective item.  Best regards.  Steve.  -----Original Message----- From: 	Kitchen, Louise   Sent:	Wednesday, July 18, 2001 3:00 PM To:	Douglas, Stephen H. Subject:	RE: EWS Tax Department Update Good report - these are all the deals under the Americas which I know nothing about - what are they? Thanks Louise Panama Trading Office - Had discussions with the Transaction Support group and PWC-Panama regarding Panamanian tax return. 		Enron of the Americas is the 100 percent shareholder of a Panamanian trading subsidiary called Enron Capital & Trade Global Resources Corp.  (""ECTGR"").  Essentially, by transacting through this company and keeping income invested off-shore, Enron is able to avoid payment of taxes on trading income generated by ECTGR.  This result, however, requires that ECTGR trade in Panama in a manner that is not taxable (essentially, ECTGR must trade products that are delivered outside of Panama or within Panama inside a free-trade zone).  The Panamanian government has requested that we establish that ECTGR's trading income is derived from qualified activity and the EWS Tax Group is, in turn, working with Transaction Support (which books ECTGR's trades under a Services Agreement) and PWC (which files the Panamanian return for us) to properly document things for the government.  We are confident that our position with regard to ECTGR will be agreed with.  Project Atlas Tube (""Atlas"") - Met with origination team and EWS Reporting and Analysis Tax group to discuss initial deal structure and related tax consequences.  Atlas consists of an inventory management strategy whereby an Enron special purpose vehicle will both buy hot rolled coil steel from and resell the same to Atlas Tube, Inc. on a just-in-time inventory basis. 		This is a very interesting deal but was misplaced in the report - it should be listed under Enron Industrial Markets.  It is similar to the ""Huntco transaction"" and I would be delighted to send you a transaction chart if it would be of interest.  Let me know.   Project Desperado (Velocity III) - Met with Enron Corp. tax and deal team regarding Velocity III transaction and structure.  Reviewed and revised transaction agreements and discussed such with Enron Corp. tax and deal team. 		This transaction involved the sale of various equity investments that had been made by Enron of the Americas in various companies (most significantly, Catalytica, Advanced Mobile Power Systems and Hanover Compressor) to Whitewing Associates, LP.  A total of approximately $205 million was raised in connection with the sale and resulted in positive funds flow for accounting purposes.  Whitewing LP is a deconsolidated entity in which Enron possesses an approximate 98 percent economic interest (deconsolidation is achieved, as it has been explained to me, by virtue of Enron sharing voting control with an unrelated person - the Osprey Trust which, in turn, is essentially John Hancock).  The sale of these investments, from a tax perspective, resulted in a slight tax gain (approximately, $61 million) that had been previously reserved for for financial reporting purposes. Project Hartwell and Project Athens Energy Centers - Advised regarding state income, franchise, sales and use taxes relating to construction of power plants in Clark and Hunt Counties in Georgia.  Plants to be sold prior to commercial operation. 		Enron of the Americas is developing two plants (described as ""Simple Power Plants"") in Georgia with the intent of selling the plants before they become operational.  EWS Tax analyzed the various state and local taxes applicable to the construction of the plants, inputs (i.e., natural gas) to the plants during operations and income resulting from operations.  Georgia imposes a sales tax on components used to construct the plants (granting, as well, however, an exemption from such taxes if appropriate tax certificates are acquired), provides a state tax exemption on the purchase of natural gas if it is used to generate electricity (but, otherwise, the local government charges a 3 percent tax on such natural gas) and, finally, taxes income earned by the company generating the electricity (at 6 percent on U.S. federal adjusted net income). Utiliquest Transaction - Met with deal team to discuss disposition of ENA's 74% interest in Utiliquest LLC.  Reviewed unit purchase agreement and met with outside counsel to other unit holders to discuss tax structuring and benefits of using synthetic 338(h)(10) structure. 		Utiliquest is an investment in a utility locating company that the Principal Investment Group of Enron of the Americas is selling.  EWS Tax helped develop the structure by which the purchaser of the investment will be able to push their purchase price paid for the stock in Utiliquest to the assets of Utiliquest (essentially, this improves the purchaser's after-tax yield (through increased depreciation) without detriment to Enron).    -----Original Message----- From: 	Douglas, Stephen H.

FROM:MR. HARRISON KARNWEA WINPOE 
TEL/FAX:27-11-5076559
EMAIL:harriwinpoe02@web-mail.com.ar
JOHANNESBURG, 
SOUTH-AFRICA. 

ATTN: 

Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is MR. HARRISON KARNWEA WINPOE from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN YORMIE. WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. you can verify this from this international newspaper website below:

http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm

Before he was killed, my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA, and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund. 

My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $21.5Million,(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army. 

You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction. Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you. 

This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. 


Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently either by,Fax or email on harriwinpoe02@web-mail.com.ar


Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Mr.Harrison Winpoe 
For the Family.

The following table summarizes the PV quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the Navy Yard.  You may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates (unitized) on the value of the transaction.  Because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price, an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal.  

As a reminder, the base valuation makes very reasonable (and conservative) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal.

They manage the Harvard University endowment and Jason works in their commodities group.  	We are talking to him about the possibility of buying equity in the KCS deal. Specifically, they will buy Trust  certificates that CIBC currently owns. The reason why this is important is that CIBC negotiated certain equity rights which effectively gives them veto rights over debt. CIBC is unwilling to give up their rights, so we are looking into the possibility of having HMC buy them out. HMC will not insist on having these rights. 	With this background in mind, I need your help to answer some of the following question with regards to KCS. Can you or Charlie go through the following questions and we can discuss them afterwards. I know the answer to some of the questions, but not all.

I haven't spoken to stu yet, but a couple questions: is there a floating price offtaker lined up for the gas?  does production occur daily over the course of the month?  how would physical sales be priced, considering the fact that the basis is already secured?  The offtaker must either pay NYMEX prices for the gas, or else the packaged basis swap must settle on the same terms that the offtaker calculates the prevailing basis...  would the offtaker pay bidweek prices or daily nymex settles...? What is the ""excess cash allocated to equity""?  some sort of fixed payment? when is that made?  the ""total"" line would imply that the ""excess cash"" is paid immediately, or else that the value is already a PV number, since it is not being discounted...  what is the certainty of that payment? Based on current NYM pricing, I get the NPV of unhedged volumes worth about 3.4m, making the total including excess cash payment 5.45m...

There's good news and then there's better news. For Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), every day just seems to be a front-page top-of-the-fold story. Take Wednesday, for instance. Delivering on projections made earlier this month that it would meet or beat consensus earnings estimates, KMI reported great news, with a 107% boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago, and year-to-date earnings up 42%. However, KMI's general limited partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. (KMP) almost trumped the broadcast, with its announcement that it would buy a 2,600-mile Texas natural gas pipeline system for $360 million and split its stock two for one. 
KMI's net income for the quarter was $49.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, compared with $24.1 million, or $0.21 for the same period of 2000. During a conference call with investors, CEO Richard Kinder said earnings were driven by its pipeline partner KMP whose earnings ""more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago,"" adding that would be ""hard to imagine we could have had a much better quarter."" Calling KMP the ""real driver of the real growth,"" Kinder said that ""while no company can escape economic downturn, KMI is about as minimally exposed as possible."" 
Kinder, who said the company is still on track to make additional acquisitions or growth plans before the end of the year, also hinted that another pipeline expansion announcement could be forthcoming. KMP, he said, is in discussions about a ""major expansion in the Rockies."" Although the West Coast is on most companies' radar screens for pipe growth, Kinder said he thought that a possible pipeline expansion ""should go east, but we're just talking."" Calling production thus far in the Rocky Mountain basin ""a great story,"" Kinder said the company had ""major advantages, and it looks pretty good so far."" He did not detail when any announcements may be made. 
KMP's newest pipeline deal, with an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corp., includes pipe that primarily transports gas from South Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast region to the greater Houston/Beaumont area, a ""very good growth market,"" Kinder said. The assets are currently leased and operated by KMP as a major part of the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (KMTP) business unit. KMP also signed a five-year agreement to supply almost 90 Bcf of natural gas to chemical facilities owned by Occidental affiliates in the Houston area. 
With KMP's earnings tied into KMI's, Kinder said that ""as the operator, we are very familiar with the assets involved in this transaction and their excellent growth potential."" The transaction, expected to close in the third quarter, is expected to be immediately accretive to per-unit distributions by about $0.08 annually. Under the lease terms, KMP will pay $40 million annually from 2002 through 2005 and $30 million annually through 2026. 
On track to deliver more than a 40% increase in earnings per share this year, Kinder pointed to KMI's ""premier, fee-based portfolio of midstream assets,"" adding that KMI was ""comfortable"" with current 2001 consensus earnings estimates of $1.84 per share, but said KMI would raise its 2002 estimate to between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. 
Breaking down its earnings by business segment, Kinder said KMI will receive $67 million in total cash distributions from KMP for the second quarter of 2001, up 81% from $37 million a year ago. ""As KMP's cash flow grows, KMI's general partner share of that cash flow grows dramatically,"" he said. ""KMI's cash flow from KMP increased significantly due to internal growth in KMP's pipeline and terminal segments and the strong performance of recent KMP acquisitions."" After equity accounting and amortization, KMP contributed $60.5 million of pre-tax earnings to KMI in the second quarter, up from $28.3 million a year ago. 
The Product Pipelines segment delivered a 57% increase in earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of $101.8 million in the second quarter, compared to $65.0 million during the same period a year ago. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment produced segment earnings before DD&A of $39.6 million, a 24% increase, which reflected strong earnings growth from Red Cedar Gathering Company and the inclusion of additional gas assets that were transferred from KMI to KMP at the end of 2000. ""Adding Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline to this segment has made our gas pipeline business more seasonal, shifting more of the segment's income to the first and fourth quarters,"" Kinder explained. ""For this reason, the year-to-date increase of 56% in segment earnings before DD&A is more representative than a second quarter comparison."" 
Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), a KMI subsidiary, earned $80.3 million in the quarter, up from $80 million in the second quarter of 2000. NGPL benefited, said Kinder, from its ""successful recontracting of its long-haul transportation and storage capacity,"" adding that the subsidiary expects to add approximately 3,000-4000 MW of gas-fired capacity annually through 2004, ""which should boost demand."" 
Power earnings surged, recording $18.8 million, compared with $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2000--a 119% jump, which the company attributed to growth in fee-income associated with gas-fired power plant development. Two 550 MW plants, expected to come online in the second quarter of 2002, are under construction in Little Rock, AR, and Jackson, MI. ""Both of those are on schedule and on budget,"" Kinder said. 
Retail was the only segment that was down, but Kinder offered a positive spin on this as well. With earnings down $2.2 million from a year earlier, he noted that earnings in the second quarter of 2000 were boosted because of an earlier than normal, high-demand irrigation season. ""However, it's precisely that type of volatility that led us to initiate a weather hedging program in late 2000 to normalize our summer-irrigation and winter-heating load. With our hedging now in place, Retail earnings are up 6% year-to-date, and we remain confident that Retail will deliver approximately 10% growth in segment earnings this year."" 
By itself, KMP, the largest pipeline master limited partnership in the United States, had a record quarter, with every business segment producing increased cash flow and earnings. ""Our results reflect both excellent internal growth and outstanding performance by recently acquired pipeline and terminal assets,"" said Kinder. KMP declared a second quarter distribution of $1.05 (an annualized rate of $4.20) per unit, that will be payable Aug. 14 to unitholders of record as of July 31. The distribution is 24% higher than the distribution of $0.85 per unit paid for the second quarter of 2000.The two for one stock split will be distributed on Aug. 31 to holders of record on Aug. 17. 
This is the second time that KMP has split the units since its formation in February 1997, Kinder noted. ""Since then, KMP has turned over almost 600% to its unitholders."" KMP reported record quarterly net income of $104.2 million, or $0.72 per unit, versus $71.8 million, or $0.70 per unit, in the second quarter of 2000.

El Paso Natural Gas this week received approval to begin the internal cleaning of its Line 2000, which would convert the former All American oil pipeline to gas service. The internal cleaning, or ""pigging,"" will begin at the La Paz pump station, and when this portion of the conversion is completed, the project will add about 230 MMcf/d of new capacity by Aug. 31. 
El Paso bought the line from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. in early 2000.  It extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. The purchase also included any fiber optic rights that All American had along its entire 1,233-mile system. 
El Paso was awarded a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate to begin the conversion project in May, and then began a binding open season for additional capacity, which extends through Aug. 2.  The open season is for 230 MMcf/d of capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, AZ. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to Line 2000 from McCamey to Ehrenberg, with a projected in-service date of mid-2003.

Both the Assembly (AB82xx) and the Senate (SB 78xx) will pass MOU bills, but different versions that will not be reconciled until after the 30 day recess, if then.  Disaster is once-again put off until later, as both bills will pass on a non-urgency basis (as predicted yesterday) meaning that there is a 90 day delay for implementation.  This means another round of amendments, redrafts, negotiations, etc.

Sept.15 remains the key deadline.  Bank creditor forbearance will expire and in our view has only a small chance of being extended.  Moreover, FERC will have made its refund ruling by then and it is unlikely to be generous to California.

The worst case scenario for SoCal is that Burton continues to push SB78xx after the recess. For those who want to know why, keep reading. Otherwise, look for more updates later today as the full Assembly and Senate meet to vote on the MOU bills and the budget.

RJ

In committee, SCE detailed their opposition to SB 78XX.  Bob Foster (VP External for SCE) testified to  the following:

There are three problems with the legislation:
1.  Amount of haircut that SCE can sustain - cannot sustain $1 billion. (Note that many California politicians think that SoCal can get this from FERC refunds)
2.  Framework going forward for regulatory process on procurement is absent in the bill.
3.  The bill does not get the state out of the procurement of power.

Foster stated that even with the bill there is still the threat of litigation and involuntary bankruptcy. He stated that faith in the regulatory process is gone and that there needs to be an understanding that operating costs will be recovered and that a procurement framework is in place.  There also needs to be clarification on the reasonableness review process.

Question from Senator Dunn:  What would be necessary in the bill to get SCE to creditworthy status?

Response:
- Operating costs will be recovered
- Procurement framework
- Balancing account for over and under collection
- The amount of the haircut

SCE was asked how much of a haircut they could sustain and still be
creditworthy; Foster said that amount was $400 million.

Sen. Speier asked if the rating agencies had a chance to review the
legislation and if they said it was okay would SCE be in support. Foster stated that the bill does not meet the creditworthy test and he would be surprised if the ratings agencies did approve of the bill.  However, SCE probably would not be in support.

Sen. Morrow asked about the rating agencies and whether they have reviewed this type of legislation. SCE responded that the ratings agencies participated in a conference call with their lead bank and indicated that this type of proposal would not get SCE to creditworthiness.

Other problems with the bill outlined by SCE:
- Sunrise Plant:  It has been proven that the rates charged are cost-based and SCE opposes any PUC oversight of these rates.
- Transmission Lines:  SCE has problems with just charging book value of the trans lines in SB 78XX.  The debt is backed by a trust indenture and the trustee would not approve of the transfer without compensation.
- 125 kwh customers:  SCE does not break customers at this level and it
would be difficult for SCE to make this determination.
- Conservation lands:  Some lands provided in the bill are part of SONGS and are pledged for mitigation.
- The bill needs to be clarified regarding SCE vs. the parent company
references in SB 78XX.

Foster stated that, because the bill does not cover the PX liability, SCE could find itself in involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes and is signed - he does not know.

Sen. John Burton said that SB 78xx is the bill that is going to be considered in the Senate. He said it wasn't going to be AB 82xx or Ab 83xx. 
He said to the representatives of Edison at the hearing: ""I want to disabuse Edison of the notion that it is going to get a good deal at the end of the rainbow, because it is not going to happen...You will get the ability to sit down with the generators, who are your creditors, to cut a deal...This is what I kept telling people was going to happen, and this is what is happening. I am about the only person for the bill. Many of my members don't really want it. But God forbid Edison doesn't want it.""

We are going to have to let the plan rule , however, I think this points out how important it is to always stipulate that the grant agreement rules.  Either verbally or in writing, we need to say "" generally it is the shorter of the term of the option or 3 years.  This depends on when the grant was made.""

The Q&A is not binding -- it clearly states that the plan prevails.  Unfortunately, some people have grants that do not have the 3-year period to exercise, although I understand that most of the more recent grants do have the 3-year period.

Pat, let me know if you disagree.

OK. So what do we say to these people ""plan prevails, Q&A may have been misleading, but tough""?

If Mich tells me that Q&A is not legally binding on us I am fine with above. Since they are leaving us I have no desire to give them more than the plan entitles them to, but I am frustrated that we stated 3 years so clearly in Q&A.

Your position that the general disclaimer on the Q&A of March 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable.  If the answer to this specific question, shown below,  was that various plans had various periods for exercise, then that should have been the answer to the question, not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years.  I, and I am sure many others, made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity.  I would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant.  I use the term ""expiration date"" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with Enron.  

With regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed, anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger, spin off or sale of a company.  Special provisions were made to exclude HPL employees from the new all employee stock option plan, special provisions were made to provide a 5% payment to HPL employees in lieu of the new stock option plan, special provisions were made to consider HPL employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and I feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees.

Lal Echterhoff

From March 8,2001, Q&A:
""1.	With the transfer to AEP, will my termination be listed as involuntary so that I can exercise my vested options?
Yes, your transfer to AEP will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from Enron.
 2.	What is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options? 
 The period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination, retirement, death or disability is three (3) years.""

Subject:	STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS 


	We have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options.  The Q&A dated March 8, 2001 stated three years as the 	exercise date for options.  However,  on page 1 of the document, a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock 
	option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program.  

	If you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration, not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document, this is 	correct and follows the provision of the plan document.  Some employees have options granted under a DIFFERENT stock option plan and that plan carries
	a three year term of expiration.  Please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under.

	Additionally, the document was intended to provide general information only.  Page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case
 	there were any errors made in the document.  Additionally, we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review.  Enron provides
	the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document.

	I apologize for any confusion this may have caused, however, the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which Enron determines 
	the termination date.  Please call me if you need to discuss your options, however, understand that I cannot speak with you regarding other employees' 	compensation/options.

Subject:	ENRON STOCK OPTIONS OF HPL EMPLOYEES


Gentlemen: 
Attached below are copies of some correspondence between Fran Mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from Enron due to the sale of Houston Pipe Line to AEP. 
  
Apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such cases--the norm seems to be three years.  However, employees who were able to participate in the original ""all-employee"" stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year.  It seems that employees who joined Enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree, but were allowed a three-year period in the case of involuntary termination.   
Following are the facts material to this issue: 
1. Fran Mays was represented to HPL employees as the authoritative source of information regarding Enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of HPL. 
2. Even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist, the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative Enron source.  It is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation. 
3. In an instance of a divestiture, merger, or other change of control of a company, in my personal experience, there can be, and often are, modifications and exceptions to benefit plans. Usually this is done in the interest of fairness to  employees affected.  In my own case in the sale of HPL, there was an exception made since I did not retire from Enron, but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired.  This allowed me to be vested in some stock options that I would have lost.  The monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since I only had about 25 unvested share options, but it is a precedent. 
4. I submitted to Fran Mays, through my supervisor, a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period. 
5. The only response to the specific written question that I submitted was contained in a general Q&A format response from Fran Mays which contains an unequivocal, direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of HPL is three years. 
6. There was a disclaimer in the Q&A document that referenced plan documents.  A disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity, but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct, clear, unequivocal statement of fact.  There is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact. 
I, among a number of HPL employees who are former Enron employees, made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the Q&A that we had three years to exercise all options.  The one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences.  Although I recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options, in my case the combined impact could be very significant. 
From AEP's perspective, Enron employees who agreed to stay with HPL and move to AEP with the sale added a great deal of value to the HPL acquisition.  It seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited Enron. 
I am requesting that the time to exercise the original all-employee options be extended to three years.  This would make this stock option plan consistent with other Enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to HPL employees that the period would be three years.  This change would allow HPL employees who acted as loyal Enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted Enron to feel that they were treated fairly by Enron.

because I was embarrassed. Not only has your system increased the size of my
manhood while erect, but it has helped my size while flaccid as well. I hang
bigger, and I feel more like the man I should have been all these years. The
change is tremendous, I wanted to send you this note to let you know what it
has done for me, and of course to order more LONGZ! Leroy, Brooklyn

Rob shook his head to indicate that he could not understand; so they led
him to the chief--an immense, bearded representative of the tribe of
Kara-Khitai, the terrible and relentless Black Tatars of Thibet. The huge
frame of this fellow was clothed in flowing robes of cloth-of-gold, braided
with jewels, and he sat majestically upon the back of a jet-black camel
Under ordinary circumstances the stern features and flashing black eyes of
this redoubtable warrior would have struck a chill of fear to the boy's
heart; but now under the influence of the crushing misfortunes he had
experienced, he was able to gaze with indifference upon the terrible visage
of the desert chief

BILLS AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,

JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
Reply to allenshalomai@yahoo.co.in

Dear Friend,
I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department 
of Amalgmated Bank of South Africa here in Johannesburg,
South Africa.In my department we discovered an abandoned
sum of US$10m dollars (TEN Million US dollars) in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR.
ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with
his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but
unfortunately we learnt that 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is
therefore upon this 
discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal
to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to
the deceased for 
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming
for it and we 
don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill.
The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such
money remained 
unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transfered
into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as
next of kin in this 
business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a
foreigner and a South African cannot stand as next of kin
to a foreigner.
I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect
to the provision 
of a foriegn account , 10% will be set aside for expenses
incurred during 
the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will
visit your country 
for disbursement according to the percentage indicated
Therefore, to enable 
the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you
must apply first to 
the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased
indicating your bank 
name, your bank account number, your private telephone and
fax number for 
easy and effective communication and location where in the
money will be 
remitted.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or
email the text of 
the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice
this transaction 
is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all 
required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You
should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.For security resons

Another thing I'd like to know is who else at Enron is listed as an officer of EPMI.  And also, Sara Shackleton discovered last week that the Enron BOD did not actually approve me being designated as a RAC officer, so I'm wondering if the slate of officers for EPMI that was submitted to California for the regulatory requirements is invalid.  Evidently the change from Ted Murphy to me was overlooked in the paperwork approved by the BOD meeting, and the plan is to ratify it retrospectively in this next BOD meeting.    This isn't something that keeps me up at night, but it is of concern to my husband, especially since I am unable to explain the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.     Thanks for your help,   Cassandra. x30429   -----Original Message----- From: BoSchultz@aol.com [mailto:BoSchultz@aol.com] Sent: Thursday, July 19, 2001 3:41 PM To: Schultz, Cassandra Subject: (no subject)             SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 18 (Reuters) - A California legislative panel voted  Wednesday to ask the state Senate to cite Reliant Energy Inc. < REI.N > for  contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential  documents.  The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 6-0 to  move against Houston-based Reliant, which joins fellow Texas energy giant  Enron Corp. < ENE.N > in facing what could be the first contempt citations  imposed by California's state senate since 1929.  Senate aides said the panel, which is investigating charges of market  manipulation and price gouging in California's energy crisis, would now begin  preparing a full report on Reliant's noncompliance for the full Senate.  The committee's report on Enron could be ready for submission to the full  Senate Thursday, they said, adding that continued efforts to negotiate an  agreement had proved fruitless.  According to state law, California's senators must use the reports to decide  whether to slap sanctions on the two companies. They also have the option of  fining or imprisoning company senior officers.  Enron, for its part, has filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court  challenging the investigative committee's authority to subpoena company  documents.  Senate aides said Reliant could follow the lead of another energy company,  Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. < MIR.N >, which has avoided the contempt threat by  cooperating with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements,  open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents  there relating to the company's recent business in California.  The committee also voted on Wednesday to suspend for 30 days proceedings  against number of other energy firms, including Duke Energy Corp. < DUK.N >,  Dynegy Inc. < DYN.N >, Williams Cos. Inc. < WMB.N >, AES Corp. < AES.N > and NRG  Energy Inc. < NRG.N >, pending a review of their compliance efforts to date.  Enron has argued the committee has no legal jurisdiction over wholesale  electricity prices, which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory  Committee (FERC), and that the committee's proceedings violate the company's  legal rights.  State officials have accused the energy companies of overcharging California  power agencies and utilities some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity over  the past 14 months, which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold.  Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's  poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough  power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its  industries.  00:10 07-19-01  Copyright 2001 Reuters Limited.

Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Morgan (E-mail) Subject:	FW: Bridgeline Application Deficiencies David, enclosed is an electronic copy of a ""deficiency"" letter pertaining the storage permit application.  The deficiencies are minor in nature and should be easy to remedy. Robert Morgan and I met with Joe Ball yesterday and had a chance to discuss the permit application.  The meeting was not planned, but it just so happened that Joe had recently completed his review of the application. We also discussed the timeline for a final order approving storage in the cavern.  Assuming we can provide the information requested in the letter on or before July 6, we can take the application to hearing on July 26.  After the hearing there will be a 1 week post-hearing comment period (approx. Aug. 3).  Commissioner's proposed order and findings of fact should be complete on Aug 10.  Within 7 days the commissioner should send proposed findings of fact to Natural Resources Committee for review and comment (Aug 17).  The order will likely be signed no later than the 1st week in September.  It is possible that it could be as early as the last week in August. I discussed with Joe Ball the issue of dewatering.  He again said that we can begin dewatering anytime now upon notice the office of conservation. Joe interprets the regs to allow us to take steps necessary to ""convert"" the cavern from Brine to NG, but we cannot store NG without a permit.  Joe considers dewatering to be part of the conversion process. I would not recommend dewatering until we have provided Joe with the information identified in the attached letter and he has set the matter for public hearing (probably the first or second week in July).  Joe will not set the matter for hearing until he considers the project to be technically sound and in compliance with Statewide Order 29-M.  After Joe has ""blessed"" this project, it is unlikely that we will have to do further sonar testing (which I understand is difficult during dewatering).

Dynegy alleges that the SPP has violated its OATT by unreasonably restricting Point-to-Point Transmission Services customers' right to change of receipt and delivery points on a firm basis.  Specifically, Dynegy complains that SPP unfairly limits changes of receipt and delivery points to those that permanently redirect the reservation (i.e., for the balance of the reservation term).  Dynegy documents several specific instances in which its redirect requests were automatically denied.

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss.

If you can wait a week or so, we can have the first of a regularly-scheduled update/report.   

Accounting (Jody Pierce) is getting the book set up consistent with the memo.  The contracts have been copied up to Portland and SF.  In a week or so, we will have a report that shows balance and some qualitative metrics, i.e. who we are talking with, indicative bids, project opportunities, etc.  For example, we included the Mitsubishis in the Roseville permit application which is being filed on July 31.  We are passing on the PGE turbine for now - they seem content to try to sell on their own.

Subject:	MHI 501 F Disposition Planning

With the shipment of two of the four units from MHI scheduled for August and no viable place to ship them, our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly.  We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Thanks!

Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less, they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north, through the Beaufort Sea, instead of across the state.  Ken Konrad, a BP executive, testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislature's Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, told the committee that an analysis ""so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route."" Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line, gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken -- which would be a major victory for Canadian officials.  Konrad and other stakeholders, including producers, analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope, were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed.  BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum, the majority property rights' holders on the North Slope, have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall, which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower 48.  The producer consortium, the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group, is spending close to $100 million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the end of this year. Konrad's testimony, as well as comments made during the hearings, indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart.  What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost. Konrad said only ""a few dimes"" separate the two major proposals, but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs. Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower 48 from the North Slope will be around $2.25/MMBtu. A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings, especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically.  Joe Maruschack, Phillips' natural gas pipeline chief, said his group is aware of the ""deep reservations"" Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route, but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well. He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups, which would have to approve the routing, construction on a sea route, logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting, and lengthy task.  If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route, Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaska's residents south of the North Slope. But in Alaska, it's about more than the supply. This past spring the Alaska legislature, with strong support from Knowles, passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route (see Daily GPI, March 30 ). Without Alaska's support, the Beaufort route could also face defeat.  ""We're coming to a divergence,"" said Harold Heinze, the former Alaska Natural Resources Department commissioner and a former energy executive. ""There's a big difference between maximizing the profitability of companies and maximizing the benefit to the state.""  Ken Thompson, a former Atlantic Richfield executive and president of Arco Alaska Inc., said one compromise would be to offer tax breaks for building along the Alaska Highway. ""They could pressure the governor and the legislature to make a deal,"" he told the committee.  Roger Marks, a State of Alaska oil and gas economist who has studied the proposed projects, said the cost savings could be as much as $2 billion using the Beaufort route, which would be about 200 miles shorter than an Alaska Highway route. Total construction costs, according to Konrad, now range between $15 billion and $20 billion.  ""Several dimes from your transportation costs could remove a lot of risks,"" Marks told the committee.  Meanwhile, Alaska remains committed to getting a pipe through the state. Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the state on Thursday to complete its review of the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co.'s previously filed right-of-way lease application to construct and operate the highway pipe. Foothills constructed what exists so far of the Alaska gas line and remains a proponent of the trans-Alaska route.  U.S. and Canadian law has designated the ANNGTC, a partnership of Foothills and TransCanada PipeLines, to construct and operate the Alaska portion. Foothills and its affiliates would construct and operate the Canadian portion.  ""This agreement is an important step in completing our land position for this project,"" said John Ellwood, Foothills vice president. ""Together with 400 miles of right-of-way we have on federal lands in Alaska and our extensive right-of-way in Canada, we are in an excellent position to expedite the building of the pipe.""  Ellwood said the application review, together with the existing permits and FERC and National Energy Board of Canada certificates, underlines the timing advantage of a trans-Alaska route advocated by Foothills and its shareholder companies, Westcoast Energy and TransCanada.  ""One thing that everyone in Washington (DC) and Anchorage agree on is that getting North Slope gas to the Lower 48 is a priority, and our approved route along the Alaska Highway through Canada can deliver that gas two-to-three years earlier than any greenfield project,"" Ellwood said. ""We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance this project and that has enhanced our ability to deliver Alaska gas to the Lower 48.""",0,0

Subject:	Meetings with EES Employees in Houston: Benevides, Whalon, Bresna n, Lewis Here is my report, attached as a word document, on my recent meetings with EES employees, Jubran Whalon, Neil Bresnan, Dennis Benevides, Jay Lewis, and Scott Stoness in Houston. A  description of their account of the documents in Houston which appear to be called for by the AG's subpena to EES follows in the text of this e-mail:  Discussion of Specific Document Requests No 1.  All contracts for retail sale:  These are both in California and Houston. Nos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on the western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003:  About five percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities. The vast majority, approximately 95%, are contracts with EPMI, which purchased all electricity load for EES.  There may be also a few contracts with APX.  EES has paper fax copies of all these deals.  Their understanding is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the California market.  While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for the power, they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the California market.  They believe all these contracts are voidable if they are revealed to any third party.  They characterize all this information as extremely sensitive.  They believe with this information, if given enough time and a few other variables, parties could construct Enron's price curves. No. 4.  Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day ahead, hour ahead, or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO:  They say there are none.  EES was a scheduling coordinator, but never used the function. No. 5.  Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon EES to meet contractual obligations to NU's customers in California:  There are no such documents. No. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost of purchasing electricity in California:  They do not believe there are such documents, but there may be presentations on this issue. No. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary to serve customers:  All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with these goals.  They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive. They use these on a daily basis.  Most of these goals are based upon the price curves.  They also receive month end reports which show how each division is doing according to these corporate goals.  They believe that a corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports. Vladimir Gorny (sp?) was said to be the person in charge of these. No. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to default utility distributors in California, including documents relating to cost savings:  They believe these documents exist in Houston.  They believe there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to utilities.  They believe Don Black would have these.  They believe all these documents would reveal price curves. No. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in California:  There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject:  They believe that Don Black would have them. No. 10.  Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about decisions made to return direct access customers in California:  These would be the same documents as No. 9. No. 11.  Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in electricity in California:  They don't know if these documents exist or not. There may be some presentations on the subject. No. 12.  All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California:  They construe this request to refer to origination documents.  These would be with the person that was in charge of selling services in California during the period in question.  They believe Doug Condon (sp?) or Harold Buchanan would have these documents. No. 13.  Documents that show sales to California Department of Water Resources:  They don't believe there are such documents. Nos. 14, 15.  Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase electricity which they prematurely terminated:  They don't believe there are any contracts which they prematurely terminated.  Some contracts were terminated but by agreement.  The only possible exception may be the University of California contract. No. 16.  Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for risk management.  They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde, Vice Chairman of EES, might have such charts. No. 17.  Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity: These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have. No. 18.  Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions: They believe Jess Hewitt's department might have these.  They believe these refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among EES traders. No. 19.  Documents relating to development approval of charters and objectives for making risk management decisions:  They believe there is a master agreement on this subject.  They believe Rick Byers (sp?) might have this agreement.  They also believe this request refers to guidelines regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management policies. Nos. 20, 21.  Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California: Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES.  They believe that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI, but had no direct knowledge of them.  They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this. EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas.  However, they probably purchased most of it from Enron North America.  <> ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Subject:	FW: Status Report of Enron Corp and EES document identification and production efforts in response to California investigative subpoenas 	We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunn's Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AG's subpoenas to Enron Energy Services. Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our office. This is our report on the status of this document identification and our plans, subject to your direction,  to continue this effort next week. The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues regarding the production to  Dunn's Committee that Mike Kirby should address as soon as possible. I. Status of EES' Response to Subpoena from AG As we previously reported, we have completed a preliminary investigation of documents in the EES's offices in California which are responsive to the subpoena from the attorney general.  Below is a report of (1) documents collected (2) documents we need to collect soon; and (3) action items which we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents. 		A.	Documents Collected We have copies of the following documents: *	Contracts from the San Ramon office *	Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa office 		B.	Documents to Collect We previously identified the following relevant documents.  However, we have not yet collected them into one central location: *	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities. These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled ""California Rapid Response"" and ""California Strike Force"" and email. *	""Golden Bear"" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach *	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E). Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein. *	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities. These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled ""California Rapid Response"" and ""California Strike Force"" and email. *	""Golden Bear"" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach *	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E). Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein. *	Documents ""related to"" each contract in the possession of each account manager in San Ramon *	Current and Old Organization charts 		C.	Action Items To complete our review of the relevant documents in California, we plan to do the following: *	Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley, Dirk van Ulden, Mojgan Ahad, and Jim Wright *	Interview, and review documents in the possession of, ""Originators"" in Long Beach II. Status of Enron Corporation's Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn We are prepared to produce more than 30,000 pages of documents to the Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator Dunn.  This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before Enron's production of documents in California is complete. This memorandum is divided into three sections:  (1) substantive issues to be resolved; (2) documents remaining to be reviewed, and (3) logistical issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby. 		A.	Substantive Issues We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible.  We need guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents.  These documents include: *	Bids made to DWR & ISO.  The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO and PX, and we assume that this means ""bid data.""  However, Enron did submit bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to the DWR.  Should we produce these documents? *	Enron Business Plans.  These documents talk in general terms about strategies for developing revenue in California - not necessarily forecasts of revenue.  These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for by the subpoena.  Siting/ Generation Development documents.  This is a broad category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation. However, if the subpoena is broadly (and perhaps fairly) read, many documents within this category may be responsive.  Our suggestion is to carve out these documents, and let the Senate Committee know that we are doing so.  For example: 		.Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or controlled by Enron.  We found documents in which Enron ""controlled"" the development of the unit, but then sold it to a third party.  Likewise, Enron is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas Co-Gen facility. 		.Many of these documents contain financial data, such as supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go forward with the project. 		.We have numerous proposal and drafts, but not finalized deals, in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the energy from the facility.  These drafts are not called for by the subpoena, but documents related to final contracts are. 		.We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs to serve as Scheduling Coordinators, which apparently coincide with divestiture by the utilities. *	Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers (""IEP"") trade association.  These documents clearly are responsive.  Many, however, contain sensitive and privilege information, including information about lobbying efforts.  Thus, we need to provide notice to the IEP that we are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to review these documents before we produce them.  Additionally, we should contact their counsel to see what, if anything, has already been produced (I assume that they have been subpoenaed). *	B.	Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials maintained in the San Francisco office.  We will complete this review next week, and produce any additional documents to the repository.  The following is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed: *	Electronic documents on Sue Mara's hard drive *	Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet, Mike McDonald, and Sue Mara *	Interview Mike McDonald *	Review addition materials relating to QF's recently located by Enron. *	C. Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby *	Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the repository space.  Bob Webb, a senior paralegal, has ""volunteered"" if we need him to go. *	Staffing the Sacramento repository  We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the documents.   Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them?  Moreover, we will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce documents.  We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents because there is no one to receive them. *	Confidential Stamping We have not marked anything ""Confidential.""  Should we do that now, or should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying? *	Privilege Log We will begin creating a privilege log next week.  When do we need to have it completed? ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

This memo discusses those three meetings: > >  I. SUMMARY: > The following people attended these meetings: > *	6/19/01 Conference Call (M. Molland, A. Smith, J. Wright, T. Reilly, > D. van Ulden; R. Williams) > *	6/20/01 Meeting, at EES San Ramon (M. Molland, A. Smith, P. > Meringolo, D. van Ulden, T. Reilly, J. Eastlund, M. Ahad) > *	6/21/01 Meeting, at EES Costa Mesa (A. Smith, J. Wright, T.

(i.e. > only documents in hard copy form in SR or CM or in electronic form on the > SR or CM servers.)  It appears that many account managers regularly > download and print documents from the Document data base (housed in > Houston) or the EES intranet.

Catherine has been in Global inance for Enron Americas for the past year. She has been ranked a Category 1 during year-end 2000 and mid-year 2001 PRC. She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core ""go to"" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.

Louise and John will be reviewing these early next week.  Since Catherine is eligible and has a 1 rating I do not believe this will be an issue.  

Louise has requested that each manager write a brief statement about why the employee should be promoted.  Please submit it to me by noon tomorrow if possible.  I apologise for the late notice.  The need for a written summary just came up.  If this is an issue, just let me know and we can resolve another way.  Thanks.

Behind every successful executives career there is at least one break; one time where someone took a chance on them and they proved them right.  I am a Sr. Specialist with DealBench. With redeployment looming, I have been told to begin looking within Enron for opportunities.  This brings us to this email that I have written you; I am asking you for my chance.

I have a Business degree and 4 years of experience with Deloitte Consulting.  I have nearly 8 months of experience with DealBench, acting as the product development manager, strategist, marketer, nearly everything.  I am flexible, adaptive, intelligent, and quite possibly the hardest worker you have working for you at Enron.  True this is a bold statement, but I firmly believe it and since I've got only a few minutes of your time, I better sell hard!  I have no ego.  I am, after all, only a Sr. Specialist.  I haven't transcended into the Manager/Director level where I have seen others stubbornly think they know everything.  I am hungry; I love the business world and will do whatever it takes to succeed.

I would like to propose myself for an executive-trainee program within your office.  At other companies, I have seen this tool effectively used to help ambitious individuals learn invaluable business skills.  At Deloitte, the program was a year rotation where Senior Consultants would assist the CEO in whatever they could.  I know people that have participated and they have all learned much more than they ever dreamed.   The learning's that I would get from a year within your office would help me immensely as I work myself toward the upper echelons of management.

Bottom Line:
What's in it for you
1)  An excellent member of your team that will help you and your organization succeed
2)  An open channel to the perspective of lower levels within your organization
3)  More ambition in one person than you thought possible

What's in it for me
1)  A once in a lifetime opportunity to learn what it really takes to run a business
2)  Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge

I hope that you will take a few minutes of your time to evaluate this idea.  I truly believe it can become a powerful learning tool within Enron like it has at other companies, and I would be honored to be the first person to participate.  I wasn't sure if I should write this message (your too busy, you don't know me from Adam, blah, blah), but I decided to take a chance.  I hope that you will consider taking a chance on me.

Thanks for your time.  I have attached my resume for your review.

I hope to hear from you soon,
Zach Streight

I have looked into your VaR question and, I don't think that your Var incerase is related to your Gulf Area Basis positions.  

Between the 13th and the 16th of July you bought about (484) fixed price contracts.   You went approx 4bcf shorter NYMEX, which increased your Var from about $500,000 to about $1,500,000 ($1 mm increase from one day to the next).  Between the above mentioned days the NYMEX prompt price fell approx 17 cents.  Yesterday you again seemed to have added about (3) bcf of NYMEX shorts on a down move of 14 cents in the prompt. MERC Prompot Vols are about 60%.....

So that's my take.......
I will look further into the problem if you still want me to.

Hope that helps

Thanks

Bharat

Bharat,

I feel that my var has been overstated recently due to my recent purchasing
of gulf area basis.  As I've bought, my var has continued to increase dramatically.
I'm not sure of the reason, but typically gulf area basis rarely moves.  A $0.005
move is a rather dramatic move for example.  I spoke to Frank and he recommended
that I contact you so that you can do some investigation.  Below I've listed some of
the points I'm concerned with.  Please let me know your findings as soon as you can or
stop down (3233C) if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

This is incomplete with some bids expected next week.  A lot of companies had a late start due to the 4th of July holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension.  Bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo.  Bids are in addition to all sunk costs:

McCook Metals - 	$20MM (this is an ongoing, slow negotiation)
PPL Global - 		$15MM
Reliant			$10MM


Indicated that they will submit bid later today/over weekend/early next week:
Calpine
Allegheny
AES
Sempra
Williams
El Paso
NRG
Dynegy

I expect some of these wont show up.


Out for various reasons:
Mirant
Constellation
Entergy
FPL
PG&E
Orion
PSEG
Tractabel


If we end up with 5-6 positive bids, even if they are non-binding, I think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed/sold (DASH in process).  

One interesting note: Allegheny wants to see our offer.  If we have several reasonable bids ($10-$20), it might make sense to offer a high outlier.

I will update.
